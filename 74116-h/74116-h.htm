<h3>
I
</h3>

<p>
From a cork bench on the flat roof of the cloister,
the monk Antonio gazed over dim orange-groves and
vineyards toward the quiet Atlantic.  For many a
day no wind had vexed the waters, and the ocean
swell, as it searched the creeks and caves, hummed no
loudlier than a bee mining deeply in the bells of
flowers.  Overhead thousands of stars burned mildly.
The May night's soft airs were rich with scents of
lemon-blossom and honeysuckle: and, like a perfume
from a great hidden lily, peace filled earth and heaven.
</p>

<p>
Peace.  It was the watchword of Antonio's Order.
<i>Pax</i> was chiseled boldly in the old stone lintel over
each choir-monk's door; and, for the sake of the
lay-brethren whose Latin was less fluent than their
Portuguese, Paz had been painted between each pair of
windows on the kitchen walls.  On every one of the
monastery's books, both in the library and in the choir,
<i>Pax</i> was stamped in dull gold; and from the lips of
St. Benedict's sons as they met in cloister or garden
the salutation was ever going forth: Peace be with
thee.
</p>

<p>
Peace.  Within Antonio's breast as well as without
there reigned on this summer night a peace which
passed understanding.  Hardly fifteen hours before, the
apostolic hands of a saintly bishop had raised the young
monk to the awful dignity of the priesthood, and had
given him power to offer sacrifice for the dead and for
the living.
</p>

<p>
With eyes at rest upon the dreaming sea the young
Antonio recalled some of the hours he had spent sitting
upon this same cork bench.  All of them had not been
hours of peace.  Antonio remembered March nights of
storm, when mountainous waves uplifted white crests
in the cold shine of a racing moon.  He remembered
August dusks, when the thunder pounded and boomed
like great guns, or like enormous breakers on a sandy
shore, while the lightning unsheathed its blinding blade,
bright and jagged as a scimitar.  He remembered
December gales, with the pine-trees cowering and
creaking before the blast; and January floods raging down
the mountain.  But, most vividly of all, Antonio
recalled his hours of inward strife and tempest.  He
remembered that long night's vigil when he wrestled
and prayed against a sudden temptation to renounce
the religious life and go back to the warm, sweet world.
And he remembered those many, many hours of less
sultry, more nipping and stinging tempest when
all the arguments against religion in general, and
against monasticism in particular, went on bursting
like hailstones about his head.  Thrice during his
novitiate and once more on the very eve of his full
profession a tornado of doubt had well-nigh swung
him off his feet and hurled him back into the world.
But on this May night, within him and without, there
was peace.
</p>

<p>
Peace.  Better still, there was peace at last in
Antonio's beloved fatherland, in beautiful Portugal.  For
more than five-and-twenty years the garden of the
West had lain under the blight of war.  At the
bidding of Wellington had not the peasantry laid waste
their fields, so that there should be neither a blade of
grass nor a cob of maize for Napoleon's horses and
men?  And after Napoleon was flung back had not
the ancient kingdom sunk to be a mere colony of Brazil,
with Englishmen lording it amid the ruins?  Worse
still, had not the fratricidal strife of the Absolutists
and the Constitutionalists soaked Portugal's hill-sides
with her best blood?  But now the civil war was ended.
Napier, the amazing Englishman, had done his work,
and Dom Miguel's cause was lost.  At Evora Monte,
with the coming of May, the faithful remnant of
sixteen thousand Miguelistas had broken their swords
across their knees and dashed their muskets to pieces
against the stones at the news of their betrayal by a
selfish and ungrateful master.
</p>

<p>
During the long siege of Oporto the echoes of the
bugles had often resounded in Antonio's cell,
challenging him to imitate many a monk of bygone ages and
to exchange the cowl for the helmet.  This was one
of the most frequent shapes in which his doubts
assailed him.  He was young, he was ardent, he loved
his country; and sometimes a flush of shame would
burn his cheek as he heard of some desperate sortie
from the beleaguered city.  To be praying in a cloister
at such a time was a good work: but, so long as the
battles were actually raging, was it not a work for
women, like preparing lint?  Once, indeed, he went
so far as to approach the abbot for leave to interrupt
his monastic life while he struck a good blow for
Portugal: but the abbot confounded him by demanding
sadly on which side Antonio felt it his duty to
fight.  To the old man's question the young one could
give no clear answer.  His political sympathies were
with sterling liberalism: but he had read enough
history and seen enough of the world to know that those
who preach mostly of liberty often tolerate others'
liberty least, and that both the constitutionalism of
Dom Pedro and the absolutism of Dom Miguel were
mere passwords of opportunists rather than sincere
utterances of convictions and principles.  In response
to his silence and confusion the abbot charged him,
under obedience, to dismiss the idea of soldiering from
his mind: but whenever tidings of fresh carnage on
the banks of the Douro reached the monastery
Antonio's heart bled anew.  That Portuguese should have
helped to slay the thousands of Frenchmen whom
Massena had flung at the ridges of Bussaco was a
thing for which Massena's master was alone to blame:
but the shooting down of Portuguese by Portuguese
was a different thing.  And so it was with a brimming
heart that Antonio, as he sat on his cork bench under
the mild stars, thanked God for peace at last in
Portugal.
</p>

<p>
Peace.  Best of all, peace seemed to have begun
even for the Church and for her religious Orders.
It was true that the victorious Liberals had decreed
the expected confiscation of the military Orders' rich
possessions: but, instead of heeding the firebrands from
France and suppressing the religious Orders altogether,
the new Government had contented itself with closing
the smaller houses and distributing their old inmates
among the larger monasteries.  And, it was true that
the State was seeking to impose vexations upon the
Church: but it seemed probable that patience and
charity and prudence on the Church's part would soon
make the crooked straight, and that the Portuguese
family would once more dwell in harmony and peace.
</p>

<p>
Peace.  From the peace of the sea Antonio's eyes
wandered at last to the peace of the earth.  Roving
over wood and meadow and stream, his gaze came
to rest at last in a little clearing between the ending
of the orange-groves and the beginning of the
vineyards.  This was the monks' cemetery.  It was three
hundred years old, and the bones of nearly all the
men who had lived and breathed and walked in the
cloister under his feet lay beneath its pleasant turf
and flowers.  In the midst of the clearing a tall
and slender cross glimmered pale through the dusk.
</p>

<p>
There was not a trace of morbidity in his mood;
yet Antonio beheld God's acre with more of longing
than of shrinking.  On so soft and gracious a night
even a pagan would have found something alluring
in the thought of death.  After the day's glare the
dimness was like a veil for tired eyes, and the scented
air was like caressing arms, wooing one to everlasting
rest.  Antonio was no pagan and no voluptuary.  He
wanted to live strenuously for God, according to the
Holy Rule: but it was good to feel that whenever
the body should be worn and weary even unto death,
there would be this plot of hallowed earth for its
repose.  With his eyes upon the pale cross Antonio
looked through it into his future.  He pictured
himself living his life, as the hundreds of dead men in
the cemetery had lived theirs, in the cell, in the chapel,
and in the cloister, studying the divine mysteries,
ever advancing toward perfection, praying for those
who would not pray for themselves, rendering to
God some of the praise and worship whereof the
careless deprive Him, and striving, as it were, to
redress the balance of the world.  He saw himself
giving his keen mind, his eager spirit, his young
strength, his whole manhood to the divine office, so
that the praising of God should not all be left to the
weak, the simple, the aged, and to the fearful souls
in the shadow of death.  He knew full well that
the world did not understand such a sacrifice, and
that the mass of men were so entirely blind to the
monastic ideal that they would look on him either
as a cowardly shirker of life's duties or as a fanatical
abstainer from its joys.  But he had long ago learned
to despise the judgments of the world.  His sacrifice
was acceptable to his Lord and it was the groundwork
of his spirit's peace.  It was as though Antonio heard
from the midst of the stars His voice saying, <i>Pacem
relinquo vobis, pacem meam do vobis: non quomodo
mundus dat, ego do vobis</i>&mdash;"Peace, I leave with you.
My peace I give to you; not as the world giveth give
I to you."
</p>

<p>
Humility made haste to stifle the beginning of
pride.  This sacrifice of his&mdash;what was it, after all?
What great merit was there in yielding back to God
his body, soul and spirit?  They were God's own, and
at any moment he could revoke them.  Antonio
brought his mind back firmly to the stupendous
happenings of the morning, and to the scene in the chapel
when the bishop laid hands upon his head.  He,
Antonio, with all his unworthiness was a priest at
last, and very soon he would be called upon to offer
that ineffable Sacrifice, compared with which his own
was nothing worth.  He, Antonio, would soon stand
before the altar, offering up the Lord and Maker of
all these stars and seas and mountains, the very God
of very God, for the dead and for the living.
</p>

<p>
For the dead.  Still gazing at the pale cross, he
vowed to remember in his first Mass the faithful
departed whose dust lay beneath its pitiful arms.  And
for the living.  A league away two lights still beamed
from the windows of a farm-house, and, far out at
sea, the mast-head lamp on a fisherman's boat
twinkled like another star.  They reminded him of
the toiling men and women whose cheerful labor is
the <i>Te Deum</i> most beloved of heaven, and he vowed
more heartily still that he would always exercise his
priesthood in spiritual communion with these obscure
saints.  And, from them, his charity widened to all
Portugal.  Portugal had reeled long enough under
the shocks of war, even as her cliffs had seemed to
reel and shudder under the enormous assault and
battery of winter storms: and Antonio yearned over her,
almost as if he already held the chalice in his hand,
praying with his whole heart that this May night, with
the soft waters nestling to Portugal's side and crooning
a lullaby, might be an earnest of his country's abiding
peace.
</p>

<p>
He rose from the bench and sought the stone stairway.
Less than a mile from the monastery gate two
lanterns were bobbing violently up and down on the
road, as if they were being carried by galloping
horsemen.  Antonio strained his ears, and made out the
clattering of many hoofs and a faint clink of steel.
</p>

<h3>
II
</h3>

<p>
"Go down quickly and meet them at the gate,"
said the Prior to Antonio as soon as the young monk
had finished his rapid story.  "If they are Miguelistas
tell them they cannot be harbored here.  Say the war
is over and we have suffered enough."
</p>

<p>
"And what if they are Liberals?"
</p>

<p>
"If they are Liberals&mdash;" the Prior began.  But
he stopped short with trouble in his face.  "If they
are Liberals," he repeated slowly, "they are coming
here for no good."
</p>

<p>
"There is not a moment to lose," said Antonio.
</p>

<p>
As he spoke the door of the nearest cell opened and
a third monk appeared.  He was older than Antonio&mdash;perhaps
forty years of age.  His fine features were
pain-worn, and, in spite of the softness of the night,
he was drawing his black habit closely round his
slender body.
</p>

<p>
"Here is Father Sebastian," cried the Prior.  "He
will go with you.  Father Sebastian, there is fresh
trouble.  Antonio has heard soldiers.  Meet them at
the gate.  Tell them of the Abbot's illness.  Take
them to the guest-house.  Say I will speak to them
there.  Run!"
</p>

<p>
Antonio gathered up his habit and sped off like a
hare.  But at the entrance of an avenue flanked by
giant camellias he halted, suddenly remorseful.
Sebastian overtook him.
</p>

<p>
"Don't wait for me.  Run on," he panted.
</p>

<p>
Antonio plunged into the dark tunnel.  Before he
had run half its length the cracked bell at the
monastery gate broke into an insolent din.  Where the
camellias ended he slackened pace and allowed his
habit to fall once more in dignified amplitude to his
feet.  Meanwhile somebody was noisily clanking the
scabbard of a sword against the iron bars of the gate.
He drew nearer and made out a throng of cloaked
men on little white horses.
</p>

<p>
"We demand entrance," piped a weak voice, as a
trooper flashed the light of a lantern through the bars
into Antonio's face.
</p>

<p>
"If you are Miguelistas," returned Antonio, "I must
refuse."
</p>

<p>
"Miguelistas?" squeaked the weak voice.  "Miguelistas!
If we were Miguelistas you would make us
welcome like the traitors you are.  Miguelistas!  We
are no Miguelistas.  Open in the name of the Queen."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" asked Father Sebastian quietly, as he took
his place at Antonio's side.
</p>

<p>
The beam of the lantern searched Father Sebastian's
face also.  Then the weak voice began again.  But
it was immediately drowned by the strong and hearty
tones of an officer, who plucked the lantern out of
the soldier's hand and held it close to his own face
so that he could be seen while he was speaking.
</p>

<p>
"Your Reverences," he said, "we ask pardon.  But
we must enter.  We are simply doing our duty.
Your Reverences have not heard of the decrees."
</p>

<p>
"Your Excellency is wrong," answered Father
Sebastian.  "We have studied them all.  The military
orders are suppressed; but ours is not a military
order.  The smaller monasteries are to be closed; but
this is not one of the smaller monasteries.  What
have the decrees to do with us?"
</p>

<p>
"Everything," retorted the weak voice in triumph.
The officer turned in his saddle and held the lantern
up so as to exhibit a squat, blonde, elderly man,
clinging precariously to a thick-legged horse.  "Yes,
everything.  The new decree is only forty-eight hours
old.  All the orders are suppressed.  All of them,
big and little.  All of them, in all Portugal.  All of
them, bag and baggage, root and branch, lock, stock
and barrel.  It was high time.  Here is the decree in
my hand.  Open the gates before we smash them
down."
</p>

<p>
"If this is true," flung back Antonio in an outburst
of indignation, "the Government has broken its word.
But I don't believe it.  Your decree is a forgery.
You have come here to cheat and rob us.  You have
come&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Be silent, Father Antonio," said Father Sebastian.
"Help me draw the bolt.  Leave this affair to me."
</p>

<p>
The principal gate had not been opened since the
days when Wellington and his staff had made the
monastery their headquarters: but the bolt gave way
at last.  The gates turned upon their rusty hinges
with a piercing sound which cut through the darkness
like a wail.  One might almost have believed that the
genius of the place was crying to heaven for help.
Men and horses began pressing through the gate, but
Father Sebastian stood in their way.
</p>

<p>
"Senhor Captain," he said, "our Prior is at your
Excellency's service.  But our Abbot is lying sick.
He is nearly eighty years old.  This path leads to our
guest-house.  The Prior begs that he may attend you
there.  It is not far.  We will show your Excellency
the way."
</p>

<p>
The captain hesitated.  Even the feeble light of
the lanterns was enough to show that he did not relish
his task.  But before he could speak the squat, blonde
man piped out:
</p>

<p>
"Most decidedly and emphatically not.  The sick
and the aged shall have every consideration; but there
are no longer people here entitled to call themselves
Priors and Abbots.  Senhor Captain, our duty is
clear.  Let us get on."
</p>

<p>
"Your Reverence," said the captain to Father
Sebastian.  "I am sorry.  But what can I do?  My
instructions are to support the Senhor Visconde in
taking possession of the monastery.  The Prior shall
see the decree.  I will do my best not to distress the
reverend Abbot.  But I cannot follow you to the
guest-house."
</p>

<p>
He leaped down from his horse, and led it behind
Antonio and Sebastian into the avenue of camellias.
The squat civilian followed, without dismounting, and
about thirty troopers brought up the rear.  The two
monks walked with bowed heads, Sebastian praying,
Antonio burning.  No one spoke: but the rattle of
hoofs and weapons was so loud that the Prior guessed
the failure of his ambassadors almost as soon as the
last soldier had crossed the sill of the gate.
</p>

<p>
Before the noisy procession clattered into the paved
space in front of the monastery, the eighteen
choir-monks, with the Prior at their head and the lay
brethren behind, were already assembled under the
stone vault of the vestibule.  As every one of them
issued from his cell carrying a lamp or a candle they
seemed to be assembled for some solemn religious
function, such as a mass or requiem.  Most of the
monks were old men; for the long years of foreign
invasions and civil wars had not been fertile in
religious vocations.  To more than half of them
the monastery had been their only home for forty
years or more.  Hardly ten words had been exchanged
among them as to the meaning of the Prior's
summons; yet one and all of them divined their fate.
Two or three of the oldest and weakest huddled against
their younger and stronger brethren, with the look of
hunted animals who hear the dogs beginning to nose
and work at the mouths of their burrows.
</p>

<p>
Expressing his failure by a sad gesture, Father
Sebastian bowed to the Prior and passed in to join the
crowd in the vestibule, with Antonio in his wake.
The captain followed on their heels, uncovering
respectfully as the Prior advanced to meet him.  There
was a silence; but it was quickly ended by a wheezy
cry from without: "Wait for me!  This is my
business.  Wait for me, I say."
</p>

<p>
"We are waiting for the Senhor Visconde," rapped
back the captain with a touch of scorn.
</p>

<p>
"Then bring me a stool," the Viscount demanded.
"Help me down.  Bring me a stool or a chair.  Here
Ferreira, you fat dog, help me down."
</p>

<p>
The fat dog Ferreira backed up and with his arms
clasped round the burly trooper's neck, the Viscount
was rescued from the perils of the thick-legged horse.
Either from stupidity or from malice, Ferreira did
not set him down upon his feet but carried him up
the monastery steps as sailors carry land-lubbers
ashore through the surf.  When he finally landed on
the vestibule floor the Viscount might have recovered
his dignity had not another trooper, safely hidden in
the outer darkness, uttered a loud guffaw.  He turned
round angrily with a threat at his tongue's end: but
the weird black ranks of monks silently staring at
him in the smoky light scared him into speechlessness.
</p>

<p>
"The most illustrious and most excellent Senhor
Visconde will explain to your Reverence why we are
here," announced the captain dryly.
</p>

<p>
"I am at your Excellency's service," said the Prior,
stepping forward and looking the Viscount in the face.
</p>

<p>
For two whole days during his carriage-ride from
Lisbon the Viscount had been jotting down a discourse
on the inevitable victory of the emancipated human
intellect over priestcraft and superstition.  It was in
the best French manner.  Even during his fearsome
hour on the thick-legged horse, after the roughness
of the by-roads had compelled him to descend from his
chariot, he had contrived to add a flourish or two to
his peroration.  But the steady eyes of the Prior
burned up all the Viscount's fine phrases like stubble,
and he could only stutter:
</p>

<p>
"You are suppressed.  All convents are suppressed.
This Order is suppressed.  Here is the decree.  I tell
you, you are suppressed."
</p>

<p>
An indescribable sound burst from the listening
monks.  It was composed of the prayers of some,
blended with the moans of despair or the cries of
incredulity or indignation of the others.  The smoky
vault re-echoed it strangely.  But the Prior turned
upon his brethren sharply.
</p>

<p>
"We will be silent," he said.
</p>

<p>
They were silent.  A few lips moved in prayer.
Many eyes flashed fire at the despoiler and more than
one fist was fiercely clenched.  But not a word was
spoken until the Prior demanded:
</p>

<p>
"Let me read the decree."
</p>

<p>
Without waiting for an answer he took the papers
out of the Viscount's clasp and perused them from
beginning to end.  Then he handed them back and
began to think deeply.  At last he raised his head and
said loudly:
</p>

<p>
"Senhor Viscount; Senhor Captain; soldiers&mdash;you
have come here to rob God.  For years your comrades
have been pouring out their blood in civil strife&mdash;and
why?  On the plea that Portugal must be ruled by the
will of the people instead of by the will of kings.  Is
this the will of the people?  Answer me.  If Dom
Pedro had told you amidst the shot and shell of
Oporto that these were to be the first-fruits of his
victory, I say that Donna Maria would never have
reached her throne.  You have been deceived.  You
were fighting for Absolutists after all.  It is not
Liberalism to trample on every liberty save your own."
</p>

<p>
"This is stark treason," sputtered the Viscount.
</p>

<p>
"It is stark truth," rejoined the Prior.  "But I will
return to our business.  Senhores, give me leave to
prepare him for your visit, and I will lead you to
the cell of our Abbot.  Father Isidoro, go and make
all ready."
</p>

<p>
"The Abbot?" echoed the captain astonished.  And
the Viscount turning very red as Father Isidoro
disappeared, gasped out:
</p>

<p>
"The Abbot?  No.  Certainly not.  Decidedly not.
The Abbot is very old and very ill.  Your young men
have told me so.  It is unnecessary.  Decidedly not.
We will treat the sick and the aged with more
humanity."
</p>

<p>
"These papers," said the Prior curtly, tapping the
roll in the Viscount's hand, "are addressed to the
Abbot.  They are his death-warrant; and your
Excellency shall not shirk executing it."
</p>

<p>
"It is inhumanity!" the Viscount cried.
</p>

<p>
"Not on our part," answered the Prior.  "We
are his children, and we know our Abbot.  He shall
not be carried away in a litter to-morrow to die among
strangers.  Kill him here.  Kill him now.  Our
beloved father would have it so.  Senhores, excuse me.
In five minutes I will return."
</p>

<p>
Before the Prior's sandals had ceased to resound on
the cloister flags twenty tongues were loosened.  The
ranks of monks broke up into little groups, some
dismayed, others defiant.  As for the Viscount he
turned upon the captain wrath fully.
</p>

<p>
"We are fools to allow it," he cried.  "What have
we to do with dying old men?  It's a trick to work
on our feelings.  They mean to turn the soldiers
against us.  Yes, we're fools.  I say we're a pair of
fools."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps your Excellency will speak for himself,"
grunted the captain, whose disgust for his work was
growing as rapidly as his contempt for the civilian.
</p>

<p>
"Aren't we masters here?" the Viscount demanded.
"We will parley with no Abbots.  Aren't we in
possession?"
</p>

<p>
"I think not," said the captain.  "I'm no lawyer:
but the Prior says these papers are addressed first
and foremost to the Abbot."
</p>

<p>
A confused murmuring had been growing louder
and louder among the troopers who crowded the
doorway.  All of a sudden it rose to an uproar, and two
struggling men lurched into the light, locked in a
fierce embrace.  The captain sprang upon them as if
they had been two fighting terriers, cuffing them
roundly about the ears till they fell apart.
</p>

<p>
"What is this?" he thundered.
</p>

<p>
"It's about religion," sang out the fat Ferreira.
</p>

<p>
The two men bent their shoulders and eyed one
another with tigerish eyes as they prepared for a
second spring; but their comrades rushed upon them
and held them apart.
</p>

<p>
"Miguelite hunchback!" snarled the one.
</p>

<p>
"Liberal nigger!" hissed the other.
</p>

<p>
"Hold your tongues!" roared the captain, firing a
volley of oaths.
</p>

<p>
They held their tongues.  But the Viscount did not
hold his.  "Captain," he piped out, "this is mutiny,
rank mutiny.  Nigger, Liberal Nigger, indeed!  Surely
you will do your duty.  This man is a Miguelista.
He is a spy and a traitor.  He must be shot."
</p>

<p>
"Let your Excellency mind his business with the
Abbot and I'll mind mine with my men," retorted
the officer thoroughly roused and, ignoring the
Viscount's sputterings, he strode up to the soldier who
had cried "Liberal nigger" and demanded:
</p>

<p>
"José, you were wounded in Oporto?"
</p>

<p>
"Three times," said José sullenly.  There was a
saber wound in his cheek and two fingers were gone
from his left hand.  As he spoke he laid his thumb
and two fingers upon some third wound hidden by his
thread-bare coat.
</p>

<p>
"And cholera?  You had cholera?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Senhor Captain.  They gave me up for dead.
A monk saved my life.  And by all the saints of
God," he cried, raising his voice to a shout, "I'll be
shot before I do such dirty work as this."
</p>

<p>
The Viscount threw out two stumpy arms wide.
But the captain was too cunning for him.
</p>

<p>
"And sunstroke?" he put in quickly.  "I remember.
Sunstroke.  What do you mean enlisting again when
you know you ought to be in a mad-house?  Where
do you live?"
</p>

<p>
"At Pedrinha das Areias."
</p>

<p>
"Near Oliveira?"
</p>

<p>
"It is fourteen leagues from here."
</p>

<p>
"Then take yourself off."
</p>

<p>
"Senhor Captain&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Take yourself off before you are shot or hanged.
Ferreira, Da Silva, take his weapons.  He can keep
his horse because it's his own."
</p>

<p>
The scared peasant flushed and would have
answered.  But his boor's personality was top-heavy and
lop-sided, and he went down like a skittle before the
captain's next ball.
</p>

<p>
"Go home this instant!" bellowed the captain.
And helped by the friendly hustling of his wiser
comrades, José soon found himself hoisted on his old
horse and ambling under the camellias toward his
mother's roof-tree.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile a lay-brother had returned from the
Abbot's cell.  In a loud voice and with a ceremonious
air he said:
</p>

<p>
"The most excellent and most reverend Lord Abbot
is at the service of your Excellencies."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0103"></a></p>

<h3>
III
</h3>

<p>
The cell of the Abbot was a room about twenty feet
square.  Its furniture consisted of a small painted
table, two stools, two straight-backed chairs, a portrait
of Saint Benedict, a very large crucifix of ebony and
ivory, an old oak desk covered with papers and a narrow bed.
</p>

<p>
To his surprise and relief the viscount found the
bed empty and the Abbot throned upon one of the
high-backed chairs.  But his fears returned when a
lay-brother set eight candles, in a bronze candelabrum,
upon the painted table.  By their light he saw a
face which seemed to gaze on him from beyond the
grave.  To the old man's right and left stood the
Prior and Father Isidore, supporting him.  They had
vested the Abbot in a cope stiff with gold embroidery,
and they had placed his miter on his head and his
crozier in his hand.
</p>

<p>
The captain paused in the doorway, embarrassed.
Then he ducked his head and crooked his knee in
awkward obeisance and blurted out, "Your
Reverence, here is the Senhor Visconde."
</p>

<p>
"To what noble Visconde am I speaking?" asked
the Abbot.
</p>

<p>
The civilian recovered himself and answered
proudly:
</p>

<p>
"Your Excellency is speaking to the Visconde de
Ponte Quebrada."
</p>

<p>
"I thought I knew all the titulars of Portugal," the
Abbot returned in his small, clear tones, "but I do
not know the Viscondes of Ponte Quebrada."
</p>

<p>
The Visconde was nettled, but he held his chin high
and retorted:
</p>

<p>
"It is a new creation.  I am the first Visconde.
I am proud to say I have won the title by my own
merits, and not merely because I am my father's son."
</p>

<p>
"Your Excellency has commanded in action?" the
Abbot asked.  "No doubt Ponte Quebrada was the
scene of a battle&mdash;a victory?"
</p>

<p>
"Your most reverend Lordship is wrong," interrupted
the captain.  "The illustrious Visconde has
served her majesty in other ways.  To hire the
English transports for Belle Isle and the Açores meant
money.  To pay the French and Belgian and English
officers and men at Oporto meant more money.  The
English Admiral Napier, who destroyed the Miguelista
fleet, required still more money.  Money was hard to
find: but the noble Visconde had powerful friends in
London.  He knows the Senhor Rothschild, that clever
man who kept back from the English the news of
Waterloo while he made his own fortune in the Funds.
The Visconde helped to find the money."
</p>

<p>
"At what rate of interest?" asked the Abbot quietly.
And when the officer only shrugged his shoulders he
added, "Is the noble Visconde a born Portuguese?"
</p>

<p>
The Viscount boiled over with rage.  "I have not
come here to be cross-examined and insulted," he cried,
"I am here to execute a decree of the Government.
This monastery is suppressed."
</p>

<p>
"I am told the Government has sent a strong force
of soldiers," the Abbot answered.  "Why?  Because
the Government fears we may tear the decree to pieces.
I have not questioned your Excellency out of idle
curiosity.  I am the father of this family; I am
responsible for their little patrimony; and when I go to
stand, as go I so soon must, before my Lord, I must
not go as an unfaithful steward."
</p>

<p>
"The monastery is suppressed," the Viscount repeated.
</p>

<p>
"The question for me," continued the Abbot, ignoring
him, "is whether I can obey this decree or not.
We have always rendered unto Cæsar the things that
are Cæsar's; but we cannot render unto Cæsar the
things that are God's."
</p>

<p>
"The monastery is suppressed.  It belongs to the
Portuguese people," piped the Viscount.
</p>

<p>
This time the Abbot did not ignore him.  "Portuguese?"
he echoed.  "All these fathers and brethren
are Portuguese.  The Senhor Captain is a Portuguese.
The humblest of these soldiers is a Portuguese.
Apparently we are all Portuguese save your Excellency.
The Portuguese people!  Yes.  Here it is in the
decree.  From this date the possessions of the religious
orders are declared to be the possessions of the
Portuguese people.  Senhores, listen.  In time of need we
have never failed to share our last crust and our last
coin with the Portuguese people.  We are Portuguese
as well as monks.  When the French were in the land
we cheerfully gave up all we had to drive them out.
More.  There are three fathers standing here who hide
soldiers' scars under their habits, and there is one
who carried dispatches under a hotter fire than any
of your Worships have even seen."
</p>

<p>
"This is not the point," whined the Viscount.
</p>

<p>
"It is the only point there is.  Your Excellency
shall answer me plainly.  If we bow to this decree,
which of 'the Portuguese people' will enjoy our house
and goods?  Will they be sold to feed the poor and
to clothe the hungry and to pay the just debts of the
State?"
</p>

<p>
"I say the monastery is suppressed," the Viscount
responded uneasily.  "My duty is simply to take
possession.  How do I know what the Government
will do with it?"
</p>

<p>
"Your Excellency knows one thing at least.  He
can assure the fathers and brethren that he has no
secret authority, no plan, no ambition of keeping this
place for himself or his friends?"
</p>

<p>
The Viscount of Ponte Quebrada clutched the back
of the unoccupied chair for support.  Outside his darling
business of usury he had always been a weak,
foolish, poor creature, easily cowed by any strong man who
stood up to him; but the Abbot's words doubly terrified
him.  Not only did they forebode the miscarriage
of his plans; they also filled him with supernatural
dread.  The dying man had spoken in low and
even tones, as if he and his visitors were discussing
some commonplace transaction: but the unearthly face,
almost immobile between the cope and the miter,
would have frightened the Viscount out of his wits if
he had not averted his eyes from it.  But while he
could turn away his eyes, he could not close his ears;
and the Abbot's final question probed the depths of
the Viscount's scheming so unexpectedly that the
schemer quailed in superstitious horror.  For a
moment or two the cell and the black figures and the
smoky lights swung round with him.
</p>

<p>
"Also our gold monstrance," the low, even tones
persisted, "our Limoges triptych, our two chalices with
the great rubies, our Saint Jerome in the Wilderness,
painted on wood by Gran Vasco, our five silver
reliquaries, the seven-branched candlestick from Venice,
our illuminated Conferences of the Solitaries of
Cassian, and all our plate and vestments?  We saved
them from the French, burying them in the woods;
and Father Leo was shot because he would not reveal
the hiding-place.  What about these things?  Will
they be respected?  Will they be honorably preserved
in our Portuguese cathedrals and parish churches?
No doubt his Excellency does not know: but, I repeat,
he can assure us that he will not lay a finger upon
them for his own profit?"
</p>

<p>
Every face turned towards the Viscount of Ponte
Quebrada.  Fifty eyes seemed to be boring like fifty
white-hot gimlets into his most secret thoughts.  He
pulled himself together for a final attempt at bullying
bluster.
</p>

<p>
"I have been insulted enough!" he screamed.  "You
are suppressed.  That's enough.  You're suppressed,
and you ought to have been suppressed long ago.
You are the Queen's enemies.  You've given shelter
to every traitor that knocked at your door."
</p>

<p>
"This latest war, thank God, almost passed us by,"
said the Prior, stepping forward.  "While it lasted
we gave shelter to five combatants only.  Two were
Dom Miguel's, three were the Queen's.  They were
all wounded.  If they came here wounded again we
should once more take them in."
</p>

<p>
"My questions have not been answered," interrupted
the Abbot's clear, small voice.
</p>

<p>
"And they shan't be," retorted the Viscount, who
had regained his courage.  "And hark you all, you
are on sufferance here.  Keep civil tongues in your
heads and clear out quietly.  We have the right to
pitch you out into the road."
</p>

<p>
"I think not," the Abbot answered.  "The decree
speaks of to-morrow noon.  We shall remain here
until that hour; and perhaps longer.  Meanwhile your
Excellency has time to answer my questions.  Our
own answer turns upon his."
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid, my Lord Abbot, there is only one
answer possible," said the captain.  "By noon this
house must be empty, save for the guard."
</p>

<p>
"And if we resist?"
</p>

<p>
The captain meditated before he replied in grave
tones: "Your Reverences will not resist.  Your
Reverences will protest and bow, without disgrace,
to superior force.  And if any injustice has been
done, the Queen, or the judges in Lisbon, or the
ministers, or the Parliament must be moved to put it
right."
</p>

<p>
"And in the meantime," said the Abbot, "what will
become of this consecrated place, and of its sacred
belongings?  We have an inventory of every valuable
thing.  If we go at noon will your Excellencies sign
a copy of it, to remain in our hands?"
</p>

<p>
"They are not yours," squeaked the Viscount in
greedy ire as he saw the loot slipping out of his hands.
"All the things are Portugal's."
</p>

<p>
"Then, as a Portuguese, I will take care, Senhor
Visconde, that Portugal does not lose them," the
Abbot answered.
</p>

<p>
A grunt of delight came from the soldiery thronging
the cell doorway.  The Abbot took advantage of it to
close the interview.
</p>

<p>
"Senhores," he said, "we will exchange our final
answers to-morrow morning, after High Mass, at
eleven o'clock.  Till then these men will be ordered,
no doubt, to respect our house and the life we lead
in it.  The guest-house is being prepared.  I wish
your Excellencies good-night."
</p>

<p>
The Viscount of Ponte Quebrada framed an answer,
but as he glanced at the Abbot's face the words froze
on his lips and he made haste to escape from the cell,
at the captain's call.  The monks remained behind,
and the door was shut.
</p>

<p>
"Surely we are not going to let ourselves be ordered
off to the guest-house?" the Viscount began as they
regained the vestibule.
</p>

<p>
"I prefer it," said the captain curtly.  "Hi,
Ferreira, you and Pirez and Pedro Telles will come with
us.  Carvalho, I leave you in charge of the monastery.
Place four guards at the sacristy door and two at
each outlet.  Understand, no monk must be allowed to
lock or unlock any door, or gate, or cupboard, or to
go outside; no, not even the Prior or the Abbot
himself.  If they want to say their prayers in the chapel,
they may: but watch them yourself and see that
nothing is taken or hidden.  Treat them with complete
respect: but if there is any sign of trouble, send for me
on the instant."
</p>

<p>
As soon as he had approved Carvalho's choice of
sentries the captain strode out into the open air
without another word to the Viscount.  A dozen paces
ahead went a lay-brother with a lantern, Ferreira and
Pirez and Telles crowding behind him.  A moment
later the little nobleman was puffing at the captain's
side.  The captain quickened his pace by artful but
unmistakable degrees until the nobleman could only
keep up with him by a succession of little runs.
Needing all his breath for this exercise, he could not
talk.
</p>

<p>
The guest-house was not much more than fifty
years old.  An aristocratic abbot had built it for the
accommodation of his too numerous visitors, whose
comings and goings had excessively disturbed the peace
of the cloister.  It was an oblong building of granite,
standing high in a clearing.  From its moss-grown
terrace there was a view by daylight of the monastery's
whole domain, of the plain beyond, and of the Atlantic
filling all the West.
</p>

<p>
There were plentiful lights in the best rooms of the
guest-house, and broad pans of charcoal burning cosily
on the floors.  Even for their evictors the Prior and
Abbot were keeping up the best traditions of monkish
hospitality.  Two bottles of wine&mdash;one red, one
white&mdash;stood on a table, flanked by a giant loaf, a
goat's-milk cheese, and a basket of black cherries.  An iron
pot of soup exhaled comfortable odors from a brazier
near the window.
</p>

<p>
"Is this stuff all right?" sniffed the Viscount the
moment they were alone.
</p>

<p>
The captain arched his brows.
</p>

<p>
"I mean," explained the other, "is it safe?  One
has heard of such things as poisons."
</p>

<p>
"Your Excellency is not obliged to touch it," the
captain answered.  He emptied half a bottle of red
wine into a coarse glass and drank it at a single
draught.  Then he broke off a hunk of bread and fell
upon his soup.  The civilian followed his example.
For a Viscount he ate a little unpleasantly.
</p>

<p>
"About this affair down there," began the captain
brusquely as he swallowed his last crumb of cheese,
"what are we going to do?"
</p>

<p>
"To begin with, we're not going to be dictated to.
They're suppressed.  It's not for them to make
terms."
</p>

<p>
"The Abbot's questions?  Does your Excellency
mean to answer them?"
</p>

<p>
"Questions!" cried the Viscount in a fury; "the
Abbot's questions!  The Abbot's insults, you mean."
</p>

<p>
Weighing his words and maintaining his politeness
with an effort the captain said:
</p>

<p>
"My orders are to go to almost any extremity
rather than use force against these monks.  And on
the whole we have succeeded better than I hoped.
If we permit the Abbot to save his face, he will
evacuate the position to-morrow, and will fight only
in Lisbon to regain it.  At the same time I quite
understand that your Excellency can hardly answer
questions which sound like insults.  But he can leave
it all to me.  It can do no harm to sign their inventory;
and, with due permission, I assure the Abbot that the
noble Visconde de Ponte Quebrada has not the faintest
idea of dealing with the monastery for his own ends.
At noon they will go."
</p>

<p>
The Viscount looked searchingly at the captain
across the crumbs and rinds.  The captain looked no
less searchingly at the Viscount.  Each saw a certain
distance into the other's mind.
</p>

<p>
"Captain," said the Viscount at last, "as that ghastly
old corpse of an Abbot was impudent enough to
observe, I am not a born Portuguese.  Give me leave
to drop this flummery of 'Excellency,' and all the rest
of it, so that we can talk openly for five minutes.
About this inventory.  Some of the things are
valuable.  The whole lot might be worth nearly a thousand
pounds."
</p>

<p>
"I should have thought nearly eleven hundred,"
said the captain.
</p>

<p>
The Viscount pricked up his ears: but detecting
nothing ironical or suspicious in the captain's voice or
expression, he continued:
</p>

<p>
"Say a round thousand.  Out of that the Government
must have four hundred.  What do you say to&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused, studying the captain's face narrowly.
Then he jerked out:
</p>

<p>
"To three hundred each?"
</p>

<p>
The captain's conscience was not clear of past
pilferings from the noble purse.  This the Viscount knew;
for he would never have dared to depend on his
face-reading powers alone.  Yet in spite of the absence of
witnesses, he was taking a certain risk, and he awaited
the captain's answer nervously.  It came without much
delay:
</p>

<p>
"I draw the line somewhere," said the captain.  "I
don't rob churches.  Besides," he added in a
contemptuous outburst, "I believe in honor, even among
thieves.  I'm not a fool.  The stuff is worth five
thousand pounds if it's worth a penny."
</p>

<p>
The Viscount fidgeted about miserably, crumbling
up bread.  "Not five," he whined.  "Say two
thousand seven hundred.  Or three at the outside.
Now we'll suppose&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Senhor Visconde de Ponte Quebrada, we will suppose
nothing," retorted the captain, getting up in
disgust.  "I don't know what you are yourself: but damn
it all, I'm a Christian.  Will you sign that inventory
... or shall I?  And what is your answer on
your honor&mdash;if you've got any&mdash;to the Abbot?"
</p>

<p>
The Viscount climbed off his chair and struck an
attitude.
</p>

<p>
"You are armed to the teeth, while I am defenseless,"
he said grandly, "but I will not brook these
insults.  Have a care."
</p>

<p>
The captain laughed a scornful laugh.
</p>

<p>
"We'll see who laughs last," squeaked the Viscount,
stamping up to the soldier and shaking both his fists.
"We'll see who laughs in Lisbon.  What about José?
What about Liberal niggers?  Who is it that protects
traitors?  Pah!  You're a Jesuit in sheep's clothing;
you're a Miguelista spy; you're a&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The captain's long-pent rage brimmed over and
burst forth like a tide of molten lava.  He seized the
Viscount's velvet collar as if it had been the scruff
of a cat and rammed him down upon the nearest chair,
hissing:
</p>

<p>
"Take that back or I'll kill you."
</p>

<p>
The Viscount sputtered.
</p>

<p>
"Then down on your knees," said the captain: and
in five seconds he had his victim groveling on the
floor.  "Take those words back, and ask my pardon,
here and now, on your knees, before I wring your
neck."
</p>

<p>
"I ... take them back.  I ... I beg
your pardon," moaned the Viscount.
</p>

<p>
He was about to rise when the captain dropped
a heavy hand on his shoulder and forced him down
again.
</p>

<p>
"And to-morrow you sign that inventory?"
</p>

<p>
With a very foul oath the Viscount said at length,
"I sign."
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  As for the Abbot's questions you and
he shall settle it between you.  But mark.  Don't
try revenge.  If anything goes wrong with me in
Lisbon&mdash;with my promotion, with my career&mdash;I sha'n't
let you off a second time, you blackguard.  Even if
it's some other man's intrigue, it's your dirty neck
I shall come and wring.  If you want to be on the
safe side you'd better see to it that I'm major next
week and colonel before next year is out.  You son
of a pig, get up!"

<p>
When the door of his cell had fairly closed behind
the captain and the Viscount, the Abbot made a sign
that all should gather round him.  For eight months
he had not been seen in choir, and for many days
disease and weakness had imprisoned him in his bed;
but, as his spiritual family pressed forward, a measure
of strength returned to him.  Perhaps it was the
excitement; perhaps it was supernatural assistance.  He
rose slowly to his feet and, leaning on his crozier,
began:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Carissimi, nolite peregrinari in fervore, qui ad
tentationem vobis fit, quasi novi aliquid contingat: sed
communicantes Christi passionibus gaudete, ut in
revelatione gloriae ejus gaudeatis exsultantes.</i>"
</p>

<p>
The Abbot's eye rested upon Brother Cypriano, the
least lettered of the lay-monks, and, for Brother
Cypriano's benefit, he sought to turn St. Peter's words into
the vernacular.
</p>

<p>
"'Most beloved, do not think strange this fiery trial
which comes to try you, as if some new thing were
happening to you: but, sharing in the sufferings of
Christ, rejoice, so that at the revelation of his glory
you may rejoice with great joy.'"
</p>

<p>
His translation did not wholly satisfy the Abbot,
and he sought to mend it.  "<i>Nolite peregrinari</i>," he
repeated.  "Brother Cypriano, a peregrinus is one who
comes from a foreign land.  If a <i>peregrinus</i> from
China should land in Portugal, he would find many of
our most familiar customs new and strange.  <i>Nolite
peregrinari</i>.  It is as though Saint Peter would say
to us all to-night: 'My beloved, men are smiting you
and driving you forth from your only shelter.  Why
are you surprised?  Do not stand like <i>peregrini</i> gaping
and staring, as Greeks might gape and stare at
Barbarians.  This is not a strange thing: it is the old
way, the natural way of the world with our Lord and
with his own.'  If He suffered, shall not we suffer?
<i>Non est servus major domino suo</i>: 'A servant is
not greater than his Lord.'  Yes, Saint Peter, after all,
is only echoing our divine Lord's own words.  <i>Beati
estis cum maledixerint vobis, et persecuti vos fuerint, et
dixerint omne malum adversum vos mentientes, propter
me: gaudete et exsultate quoniam merces vestra
copiosa est in coelis: sic enim persecuti sunt prophetas
qui fuerunt ante vos</i>.  'Blessed are ye when they shall
revile you and shall persecute you, and shall falsely
speak all that is evil against you for My sake: be glad
and rejoice, for abundant is your reward in heaven;
for so they persecuted the prophets which were before
you.'"
</p>

<p>
The aged man's voice became almost sonorous as
he rolled forth the Latin words.  He so pronounced
the vowels that one thought of bells, some silvern,
some of bronze.  Most of his hearers had
extinguished the lamps and candles which they still held
in their hands: but here and there a flame still flickered.
Unconsciously they had fallen into such groups and
attitudes that the sable monks, with the white and golden
Abbot in their midst, might have stepped down from
some painted and gilded altar-piece of the fourteenth
century.  For a brief spell the venerable Abbot
continued comforting his children, striving to subdue their
worldly anger and to lift their dire trouble to the height
of the Cross.  He knew the whole of the New Testament
by heart, in Latin, and as he had begun his
exhortation with words of Saint Peter, he went on
quoting from the letters of that apostle only.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Et quis est qui vobis noceat?</i>" he demanded.
"'Who is he that can hurt you?'  <i>Humiliamini sub
potenti manu Dei, ut vos exaltet in tempore visitationis;
omnem sollicitudinem vestram projicientes in eum,
quoniam ipsi cura est de vobis</i>.  'Humble yourself
under God's mighty hand, that He may exalt you in
the time of visitation; casting upon Him all your care,
because He careth for you.'"
</p>

<p>
Growing fatigued at last, he sat down and became
fully conscious for the first time of his miter and
crozier and cope.  Praying Father Isidoro to divest him
of this magnificence, he seemed to recover strength
again as he faced the fathers clad simply in his habit
with a gold cross upon his breast.  With the laying
aside of his pomps his manner became more intimate
and free.
</p>

<p>
"I have been preparing," he said, "for this blow.
The characters of those men who have struck us left
me little hope.  Dom Pedro's advisers are taking a
leaf from the book of the English King Henry the
Eighth.  They want money so as to carry on a
spendthrift government, and they want lands and
great houses so as to create a new aristocracy which
will maintain them in power.  Therefore the monasteries
must be besmirched by false accusations and
God must be robbed."
</p>

<p>
"But, my father, we shall resist," broke out Brother
Cypriano, clenching his enormous hands.
</p>

<p>
The Abbot shook his head sadly.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said, "there can only be one end.  We
are men of peace, not of blood.  In my weakness and
sickness our Lord has seemed to open my eyes to the
future.  Saint Peter's words might be mine: <i>Certus
quod velox est deposito tabernaculi mei secundum quod
et Dominus noster Jesus Christus significavit mihi</i>.  I
am 'certain that the laying down of my tabernacle is
at hand, as our Lord Jesus Christ also hath signified
to me.'  Fathers and brethren, to-morrow will see the
end of this community.  For more than three hundred
years Saint Benedict's children have sought to live by
his Holy Rule on this spot; but to-morrow ends all.
We can do no more than frustrate the sacrilegious
greed of this foreign Visconde and save our patrimony
for Portugal."
</p>

<p>
Taken by themselves the Abbot's words would not
have stifled discussion, and even the unconditional
obedience they owed to him would not have held back
the more militant monks from trying to defeat his will.
But the unearthly light in the old man's eyes, which
had so terrified the Viscount, beamed forth upon these
men like a pillar of fire guiding them in God's way.
Even the burly and unmystical Cypriano yielded to
the spell.  Accordingly no one felt that there was
anything dictatorial in the Abbot's procedure when he
took their assent for granted and passed quietly on
to arrange the details of the community's last hours
beneath its historic roofs.
</p>

<p>
After the Prior, the Cellarer, and two other monks
had been consulted, it was agreed that the life of the
monastery should proceed as if nothing had happened.
Conformably to the Holy Rule, Matins were appointed
to be sung at about two o'clock, so that Lauds
could follow at break of day.  In the order of the
monks' Low Masses no alteration was made: but, for
the High Mass, the Abbot asked all to pray that he
might be given strength to pontificate.  As for the
inventory, it was decided to adhere to the Abbot's
demands.  Finally, the tiny town of Navares, four
leagues away, was chosen as the first night's shelter
after the exodus.  In Navares the Cellarer had
a kinsman, a corn-merchant, in whose house and barns
some sort of lodgings could be found.
</p>

<p>
When the Abbot was lain down at last on his hard
and narrow bed, the Prior would have had the throng
withdraw: but the Abbot forbade him.  He wished
to speak, he said, to all the fathers and brothers in
turn.  One by one the monks knelt down beside the
bed and kissed the wasted hand with love and reverence;
and to each and every one he spoke some word
of affectionate encouragement or counsel, and humbly
asked their prayers.
</p>

<p>
Antonio was the last of the choir-monks to come
forward.  As he knelt down a hush fell upon all.
Amidst the general affliction they had lacked time to
think of Antonio's bitter trial: but when the Abbot
spoke he put the thoughts of all into words.
</p>

<p>
"Father Antonio," he said, laying his old white
hand on the young monk's curling black hair, "may
our Lady of Perpetual Succor comfort you.  For the
present God does not suffer you to say your first
Mass.  But remember Saint Ignatius of Loyola, who,
of his own will, prepared himself for a year before
he presumed to offer the holy sacrifice.  Your great
day will come; and when it shall dawn, I pray you to
offer that first Mass for my poor soul and for all who
are standing here."
</p>

<p>
Antonio, deeply moved, was about to rise: but, as
he lifted his head, he felt the Abbot's hand suddenly
gripping his arm with superhuman strength.  At the
same time he saw the benign light which had beamed
from the old eyes grow brighter and brighter, till the
Abbot's whole face was transfigured and glorified.
His brethren saw it too; and, by a common impulse,
every one of them knelt down on the stones.  At last
the Abbot's voice began playing upon the tense
silence, like an unseen hand on silver strings.
</p>

<p>
"My son," said the far-away, clear tones.  "My son,
rejoice.  I was wrong.  This is not the end.  God
clears my eyes.  Long years must pass away; but I
see our chapel swept and garnished.  I see Antonio
sitting once more in choir, doing the Work of God in
his old place.  I see him standing before the high
altar.  I see him holding up our great chalice.  I see
him offering the Holy Sacrifice for us all.  Rejoice."
</p>

<p>
He ceased; and while all were still marveling at his
prophecy the light quickly faded from the prophet's
face.  With closed eyes he sank wearily back upon his
hard pillow.  The Prior made a sign.  Father Isidoro
and a lay-brother remained to tend the sufferer; and,
with full hearts and moving lips, the other monks
passed out of the chamber one by one.

V
</h3>

<p>
The short night passed without any grave disorder.
Indeed, only two light conflicts occurred.  During
Matins one of Carvalho's guards fell asleep on the floor
of the nave, and his unseemly snoring would have
hindered the general devotion if the giant Brother
Cypriano had not picked up the slumberer and carried
him out into the cloister as easily as he would have
carried a little child.  The other conflict, which was
only settled by dragging the captain from his bed at
the guest-house, broke out soon after sunrise, when the
Brethren entered the sacristy to prepare for serving
the Fathers' Masses.  At first Carvalho and his men
stoutly refused to allow a single chalice or paten or
vestment to be brought out of the drawers and
cupboards: but the Prior had stood by the community's
rights and the captain gave way.
</p>

<p>
Never before, in the oldest monk's memory, had the
Hours been so fervently recited.  Words which had
become trite through thousands of repetitions glowed
again with timely meaning.  For instance, at the
beginning of Matins, the verse "O God, incline unto mine
aid, O Lord make haste to help me" burst forth with
passionate entreaty.  The same thought was in every
mind.  In ten hours it would be noon: the Lord must
make haste indeed.  As for the Lord's Prayer every
clause of it searched the monks' hearts.  God's
kingdom seemed to be departing: but they said, "Thy
kingdom come."  With food and shelter both uncertain
they pleaded, "Give us this day our daily bread."  The
squat Viscount's greedy face rose up before them
all: yet they strove after sincerity when they said,
"As we forgive them that trespass against us."  As
directed by the Holy Rule this petition was breathed
silently: but it was aloud that they cried, "Deliver us
from evil."
</p>

<p>
Despite their exaltation and their quickened faith,
all were amazed when the Abbot sent word that their
loving prayers had been answered and that he felt
strong enough to pontificate at the High Mass.  After
Prime he called Antonio to his cell that he might speak
with him alone.  When the door was shut the young
priest was about to kneel: but the Abbot prevented
him.
</p>

<p>
"Rather," he said, speaking with the utmost solemnity,
"ought I to kneel, Father Antonio, to you.  God
and our holy father Saint Benedict have called you to
a glorious work.  It is yours to lead our Order back to
this place.  But not yet.  Be patient.  Be humble.
Be prudent.  Keep your own counsel.  Wait for the
guidance of God."
</p>

<p>
Antonio's heart glowed like a live coal within him.
</p>

<p>
"Whither God shall guide you I do not know," the
Abbot continued.  "Perhaps through dark and stony
places.  It may even be that for long years you will be
unable to exercise your priesthood and to follow up
your religious life.  But, if such should be His trial of
you, remember this.  Our blessed Lord Himself did
not break the Bread and take the Cup until the night
before He died.  Go in peace."
</p>

<p>
Throughout the High Mass the flame burned ever
more and more hotly in Antonio's breast.  He seemed,
like Saint Teresa, to have the very stuff of his heart on
fire.  From the Introit to the Communion he duly
sang every note that belonged to his duty; but, as the
sacred mysteries proceeded, he felt as if only his body
remained on the earth, and that his spirit was dwelling
with the Abbot's in a supernal world of pure ecstasy.
</p>

<p>
The Viscount, the captain, and half the soldiers were
present at the Mass, some of them assisting with
devotion.  They salved their consciences by reminding
themselves that the Almighty was more powerful than
the Government in Lisbon, and that He could be left
to look after His own business.  As for the Viscount
and the captain, in some amazing fashion they had
made up their quarrel of the night before, and it was
evident that a mysterious understanding existed
between them.  As the Mass neared its close their
nervousness could not be concealed.  After all, the
soldiers were Catholics; for even the most irreligious
of them would not wish to die without a priest.  The
Viscount repeatedly whispered to the captain his fear
that the Abbot was meditating a coup, and that he
would suddenly win a strong bodyguard to his defense
by threatening the despoilers with excommunication.
</p>

<p>
After the last gospel the Abbot advanced and stood
leaning on his crozier.  The Viscount went very red;
the captain nearly white.  But the bolt did not fall.
In solemn tones the venerable man simply repeated the
words of Jeremias:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Hereditas nostra versa est ad alienos; domus
nostrae ad extraneos.</i>"*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* "Our inheritance is turned to aliens; our houses to strangers."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
After a long pause he stretched out a fatherly hand
and pleaded in the words of Saint Peter:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Et ipsi tamquam lapides vivi superaedificamini,
domus spiritualis, sacerdotium sanctum, offerre
spirituales hostias acceptabiles Deo per Jesum Christum.</i>"*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* "Be ye also as living stones built up, a spiritual house, a
holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God
by Jesus Christ."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
That was all.  But it was too much for the Viscount
and the captain.  The captain's Latin was restricted to
a confused recollection of an assertion of Julius Cæsar's
to the effect that all Gaul is divided into three parts,
while the Viscount, who fully believed that <i>nil</i> meant
"never," knew the single phrase <i>Nil desperandum</i>.
Accordingly, as the Abbot retired to make his
thanksgiving, they laid their puzzled heads together,
wondering what secret words of command he had spoken to
his followers.
</p>

<p>
It was five minutes to eleven.
</p>

<p>
"You saw that chalice?" whispered the Viscount.
"There's another like it, only bigger.  The rubies are
from India.  They're Burmese.  They came through
Goa from the hoard of some Indian king or other.  I
know their whole history."
</p>

<p>
He was developing a humbugging tale about the
difficulty of marketing large rubies for their full value
when a gong-like sound, rich and deep, stopped him
short.  It was the great bell of the abbey which had
been ungeared during the Abbot's illness.  Ten more
strokes slowly followed.
</p>

<p>
"Eleven o'clock," said the captain.  But nothing
happened and nobody appeared.  The Viscount and
he exchanged nervous glances.
</p>

<p>
A minute later Carvalho entered and announced
that the community was assembled, with the Abbot at
its head, in the paved space which fronted the chapel.
The captain at once ordered that all the soldiers, save
the sacristy guards, should fall in and attend him on
the same spot.
</p>

<p>
At five minutes past eleven Carvalho's words of
command had ceased echoing through the cloisters,
and the men's heels were already resounding on the
stones outside.  Some one threw open the western
doors of the chapel, and a wave of warm air, heavy
with the scent of orange-blossom, surged into the cool
dimness to mingle itself with the lingering fragrance
of the incense.  The captain looked out.  He could
see the monks, all in black, drawn up in two lines
behind the Abbot, and, facing them, his own troopers,
dismounted and unkempt.  The captain strode forth
boldly into the bright sunshine, and the Abbot came
forward a step to meet him.  It was like an encounter
of two old-world champions for single combat, with
their little armies looking on.  They exchanged
salutations punctiliously.
</p>

<p>
As the Viscount pottered up in the captain's rear
the Prior took a place beside the Abbot, and began to
speak in such far-ringing tones that the soldiers
twenty yards away could hear every syllable.
</p>

<p>
"His most illustrious Reverence the Lord Abbot,"
he said, "charges me to give your Excellencies his
answer and the answer of this community.  We cannot
give up these holy places either to Portugal or to any
man within her borders: because they are not ours to
give.  If we must abandon our patrimony for a while,
we shall do so under protest against this robbing of
God and of the faithful departed.  But there are limits
to our meekness.  We are Portuguese men as well as
Catholic monks, and we shall not surrender this abbey
to your Excellencies until the inventory has been signed
and delivered."
</p>

<p>
To the consternation of the more aged and timid
monks the captain made a gesture of scorn.  All his
words and actions the night before had encouraged
them to hope that he would prove their stanchest ally
against the Viscount.  They did not know and could
not guess that he had bartered away the remains of his
honor for a promise of twelve hundred and fifty
English pounds.
</p>

<p>
"And if we refuse?" he said.  "If the noble Viscount
and I refuse; if no inventory is signed or delivered:
then what will your Worships do?"
</p>

<p>
The Prior answered promptly and firmly:
</p>

<p>
"We will see to it that your Excellencies do not rob
their masters on earth as well as their Master in
heaven.  We will see to it that your Excellencies, as
well as ourselves, obey this decree.  Portugal shall
not be cheated.  Let the inventory be signed and we
will go forth without strife to regain our rights
elsewhere.  Peace is our watchword, and we are vowed
to poverty.  But let your Excellencies refuse&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He made a long pause, and only when the suspense
had become intolerable did he add in ringing tones:
</p>

<p>
"Then these brave men who have bled for Portugal
will do their duty.  They are not hirelings: they are
volunteers and patriots.  Senhor captain, do not
deceive yourself.  Men are not born in cowls.  Under
Wellington I led Portuguese troops into fourteen
battles.  Your men love Portugal, and they do not hate
God.  I have only to give the word and more than
half of them will be mine.  Here is the inventory and
here are pens and ink.  Your Excellencies will verify
it&mdash;and sign."
</p>

<p>
Two lay brethren approached carrying a deal table,
upon which Father Sebastian laid two copies of the
inventory, an earthenware inkstand and a bundle of
goose-quills.  At the same time Brother Cypriano bore
forward a carved chair, in which the Abbot sat down.
</p>

<p>
Ungovernable rage set fire to the captain's wits at
the very moment when he needed all his coolness.
He had sold his soul and his country for gold which,
after all, he was not to receive.  He turned savagely
towards his seducer, and saw with disgust that the
Viscount, whose sense of dignity was nearly as small
as his sense of humor, had opened a vast umbrella.
</p>

<p>
"What are we to do?" the captain rapped out.
</p>

<p>
"Do?  We refuse, of course.  It's all bravado.
Leave them to me.  I will answer."
</p>

<p>
He turned to the Prior with a ridiculous air of
importance and shut up his umbrella.  But before he
could speak a word the guffaw which had so much
disconcerted and offended him the night before in the
vestibule broke again from one of the soldiers.  As
the Prior had said, these men were not mercenaries.
Their ranks comprised a salt-winner from Aveiro, the
two sons of a Lisbon saddler, a fisherman from
Figueira da Foz, two quarrymen from the Minho, and
a score or so of peasants from the Beiras: but one and
all of them had something of the fidalgo in his air, and
one and all of them was dimly conscious of the upstart
Viscount's low breeding.
</p>

<p>
The guffaw was not the worst.  Although the troopers
still stood at attention, the captain's sharp ears
detected mutterings and whisperings.  During the
morning the men had debated among themselves the
motives of the Viscount for risking his neck on horseback
in order to do work which pertained to a sheriff's
officer, and they had decided that the Abbot's demand
was prudent, patriotic and just.  Again, the hospitality
of the Cellarer, the impressive rites in the chapel, and,
above all, the holiness of the Abbot had increased their
distaste for the work they were come to do.
</p>

<p>
"Our final word&mdash;" began the Viscount, pitching
high his tin-whistle voice.  But the captain came to his
senses in time.  He seized the little man's fat arm
angrily and hissed in his ear:
</p>

<p>
"You cursed fool, be quiet.  Wait."  And, in a loud
voice, he said to the Prior, "I will sign."
</p>

<p>
A cheer from the soldiers greeted his words.  Then,
so that they might verify the treasures detailed in the
inventory, the Prior conducted his glowering visitors
to the sacristy.  The Blessed Sacrament had already
been removed: but he seemed to shrink from polluting
the chapel with their presence, and therefore he chose
a roundabout route.  Passing through the cloisters he
led the way through the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
As he entered the lofty room the Viscount, despite
his chagrin, could not repress a cry of admiration.
A dado of blue and white tiles ran all round to a height
of six feet; and, above, the lime-washed walls were as
white as the purest snow, save where the word <i>Pax</i>
had been painted upon them in shapely letters of blue.
Above the fireplace, which was in the middle of the
room, rose a canopy of burnished copper, so elongated
that it pierced the vaulted roof.  This was the chimney.
But the great surprise was a rivulet of clear water
which rushed down a stone channel the whole length
of the room.  Centuries before, the monks had
diverted a mountain stream from its bed, and ever since,
night and day, winter and summer, the cheerful waters
had gone on leaping and singing through the great
white hall.  Near its egress, at the north-west corner
of the kitchen, the rivulet ran through a square frame
of perforated boards.  Like a similar contrivance in
the vast and famous abbey of Alcobaça this frame
formed a place of storage for a few freshwater fish,
so that the refectory tables should not go unfurnished
even when the Atlantic storms kept the monks' boat
idle.
</p>

<p>
But the Prior was not in a mood to act as cicerone
to sightseers, and he strode on until the sacristy was
reached.  Carvalho's guards were at their posts, and
they had been joined by four monks who had come
directly through the chapel.  Among them were
Sebastian and Antonio.
</p>

<p>
The sacristy was dustless and spotless; and when
the cupboards were opened every inch of embroidery
and every ounce of plate were found in their places as
described in the inventory.  At the sight of the gold
and silver and precious stones the Viscount's eyes
glittered like glass beads.  He would have taken the
holy vessels in his fat hands to fondle them had not the
Prior sternly repelled him.  By way of revenge, as well
as to mislead the captain, the Viscount then set
himself to depreciate everything.  The triptych was not
Limoges, and he had his doubts about the rubies.  The
vestments were falling to pieces.  As for the Gran
Vasco, who was Gran Vasco, after all?  He was a
painter whom not one collector in a thousand had
ever heard of.  Besides, the painting was certainly a
copy.
</p>

<p>
To these remarks the Prior did not pay the smallest
heed.  When everything had been verified, he kissed
with exceeding reverence a reliquary containing the
relics of martyrs who had suffered for the Church.
Then he replaced this last treasure on its shelf and
locked the cupboard.  The captain held out his hand
for the keys, but the Prior answered:
</p>

<p>
"After you have signed, Senhor Captain.  At noon.
Till then your guards are keys enough."
</p>

<p>
Together with the four monks he quitted the sacristy,
leaving the two men to follow.  But they lingered.
To get out of earshot of the guards the captain drew
the Viscount into the chapel, and muttered hurriedly:
</p>

<p>
"We sign.  Then we pack up the stuff and bury it.
To-night we send to the Government a report.  We
tell them how these fellows threatened resistance and
tried to win over my soldiers.  We tell them how the
Abbot is an old miser doting on the gold and silver;
that we fear a raid of their sympathizers in force; and
that we have thought it wise to bury the treasure.  We
ask them to send a lock-up van and twenty more men
to bring it away.  And meanwhile..."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Meanwhile..." repeated the Viscount,
beaming and chuckling.  "Meanwhile...  By
the way, you see these tiles on the walls?"
</p>

<p>
Yes, the captain saw them.  The walls of the oblong
nave were almost entirely clothed with <i>azulejos</i>, or
blue-and-white tiles.  The multitudinous squares
formed large pictures crowded with life-size figures.
</p>

<p>
"If we could get them down some day from the
walls," murmured the Viscount, "I know an Englishman
who would pay a thousand pounds for them."
</p>

<p>
He was interrupted by Brother Cypriano, who
demanded in a peremptory tone:
</p>

<p>
"How much longer are we to wait for your Excellencies?"
</p>

<p>
They did not return through the kitchen and cloister,
but followed Brother Cypriano out of the chapel
directly into the paved space.  The captain looked
haggard, but the Viscount was radiant.
</p>

<p>
"The keys are here?" he asked.  "Good.  Then give
me a pen."
</p>

<p>
Forgetting himself in his elation, he began to sign
the name of his humble days: but he quickly scratched
out the half-written word and substituted his
grandiose signature as Visconde de Ponte Quebrada.  Then
he handed the quill to the morose captain, who slowly
subscribed his name.
</p>

<p>
"There!" cried the Viscount, picking up the great
iron keys of the abbey and the small steel keys of the
sacristy cupboard.  "Now I hope everybody is
satisfied.  I wish your Reverences a pleasant journey."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0106"></a></p>

<h3>
VI
</h3>

<p>
The big bell banged noon.  In front of the chapel
Saint Benedict's heavy-hearted sons were ready to
depart.  Only Brother Cypriano was absent.
</p>

<p>
No one stirred.  The captain glanced round with
new anxiety.  But his suspense did not last long.  A
lighter bell smote through the dull resoundings of the
great gong.  It was Brother Cypriano ringing the
Angelus.  With bowed heads the monks repeated the
Angelic Salutation.  The soldiers and the captain
uncovered: and, with an awkward grab at the brim of
his sombrero, even the Viscount made a show of
following their example.
</p>

<p>
This last act of faith being ended, the Abbot made
a sign, and two of the brethren approached him with
a litter.  The old man's miraculous tide of vitality was
ebbing as fast as it had flowed, and the captain knew
that, in the circumstances, the Minister in Lisbon
would not approve of this indecent haste.  But he had
involved himself too deeply with the Viscount to draw
back, and it was essential to his plans that the whole
monastic garrison should vacate their barracks without
delay.  Therefore he contented himself with uttering
a string of regrets which nobody heeded.
</p>

<p>
It was a quarter-past twelve when the procession
started.  The monks went forth two and two, like the
Seventy in the gospel.  At their head walked the Prior
and the Cellarer, who had much to discuss concerning
ways and means.  The Abbot's litter was borne at first
by Father Isidore and Father Antonio.  Brother
Cypriano and the other lay-monks brought up the rear.
They led five pack-mules, whose burdens contained
little more than the monks' winter shoes and habits, and
a blanket for each one.  The Prior had not asked leave
to take either the mules or their loads, but the captain
had not raised any objection.  As for their personal
belongings, the fathers and brethren seemed to be
almost literally fulfilling the Holy Rule, and to be
carrying away almost nothing of their own.  Each monk
held a small bundle, in which the four volumes of his
breviary were the principal item.
</p>

<p>
They wound down the paved way without looking
back.  The Viscount grinned and rubbed his hands.
Soon the black files were lost to sight in the avenue of
camellias, and a few minutes afterwards the strident
grinding of iron on iron proclaimed their arrival at
the rusty gate.
</p>

<p>
The captain gave a signal to Carvalho, whose men
had been busy saddling their horses, and immediately
a detachment twenty strong cantered after
the exiles.
</p>

<p>
"A guard of honor," chuckled the Viscount.
</p>

<p>
"I am obeying the Minister's instructions,"
answered the captain dryly.
</p>

<p>
"Like a good boy.  And at the same time you've
got rid of half these prying peasants.  But come, we
haven't sampled the cellar.  And I could eat a couple
of those fat trout."
</p>

<p>
The captain flung aside his uncomfortable thoughts
and agreed, with an oath, to a carouse.  The pair
plunged into the cool corridors, to ransack the larder
with small success.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the unpitiful sun was beating on the
monks' heads and on the Abbot's rude litter.  The
cruel ball of fire hung in a dome of so hard a blue that
it might have been cut from one immense sapphire.
The Atlantic chafed in its bed with a simmering sound,
and blinded the eyes like molten copper.
</p>

<p>
Carvalho and his troopers, who had been hanging on
the monks' rear, were the first to surrender.  Riding
forward to the head of the train, Carvalho in person
suggested that both drivers and driven should encamp
amicably in a neighboring grove of eucalyptus until
the fiercest heat had passed.  The Prior agreed.
</p>

<p>
Of all the eucalyptus groves in Portugal, the grove
which the travelers entered was one of the oldest and
most grandly grown.  Just above it a small pine wood
offered a deeper and cooler shade, and a rapid brook
made the oasis complete.  Almost immediately some
of the soldiers began to fraternize with the monks,
pressing upon them dark <i>broas</i> baked from maize and
rye, and handing round the wine-skins.  The monks,
in their turn, offered salt fish, which the soldiers
joyfully ate quite raw.  After the repast the soldiers flung
themselves down full length to sleep upon the
pine-needles; and although the monks produced their
breviaries and tried to say the Office, ere long most of
them succumbed to drowsiness.
</p>

<p>
Antonio was wide awake.  His share of the frail old
Abbot's weight had seemed not much more than a
feather to his youthful strength.  He looked round.
The mules and horses were browsing happily in the
lush herbage.  Carvalho and a corporal were spelling
out some papers in low tones.  The Cellarer and the
Prior were equally engrossed in writing and figuring.
Under the densest pine tree Father Isidore and Father
Sebastian were keeping vigil over the sleeping Abbot.
</p>

<p>
The young monk sauntered eastward, following up
the course of the stream.  He suspected that its
dancing waters were those which had flowed through the
monastery kitchen, and a few minutes' breasting of the
pine-crowded slope proved that he was right.  From
the top of the knoll he could make out the dazzling
white front of the chapel, framed in dark granite, and
he could hear the dull boom of the great bell striking
two o'clock.
</p>

<p>
At the foot of the knoll, half hidden in verdure, some
dilapidated buildings huddled on the banks of the
rivulet.  He descended to explore them.  The windows of
the little house were broken, and weeds choked the
garden.  There were also two barns, raised on stone
pillars to thwart the rats, a byre, a threshing floor, and
a little orangery in full blossom.  Apparently many
years had slipped by since the place was inhabited.
</p>

<p>
Having satisfied his curiosity Antonio was turning
away when a thought struck him.  He approached the
buildings again and examined them much more closely.
Then he took his resolution.  With his eyes fixed on
the glittering white chapel, which shone down upon him
like the Bride of the Lamb, he knelt in the long grass
and repeated the Benedictine prayer, <i>Excita Domine</i>.
His prayer done, he remained a few minutes in
meditation before he sought his brethren.
</p>

<p>
Regaining the knoll's top and beginning to descend,
Antonio found that the scene had changed for the
worse.  The attitudes of some of his drowsy companions
were neither dignified nor picturesque.  They
were wearing their worst tunics for the journey, and
the grey dust from the road did not improve the rusty
black of the garments.  Their bundles looked untidy
and paltry.  More disenchanting still, some of the
monks who were still awake seemed to have descended
from their exaltation and to be sourly grumbling
together over their misfortunes; while the faces of the
Prior and the Cellarer shewed that they were still
deeply debating the community's creature-comforts.
</p>

<p>
For a moment Antonio's enthusiastic faith was
shocked and chilled.  Was this cause worthy, after all,
of the bitter sacrifice he had resolved to make?  But
his doubt vanished in an instant in the light of a
thought which came to him as if from heaven.  He
thought of the great flights, the great martyrdoms, and
understood that if he could have been a looker-on at
them all, he would have seen the jewel of faithful love
shining out from a dull alloy.  Saint Benedict's flight
from Subiaco to Monte Cassino, the martyrdom of
Saint Laurence&mdash;no doubt even these holy happenings
had had their ugly elements, their sordid accompaniments.
Their realities did not correspond with the
idealized versions of stately altar-pieces, and stained
glass, and illuminated parchments, and statuary.
More: he reminded himself that, according to human
standards, even his divine Master had passed poorly
from a mean birth to a base death.  He recalled the
words of Isaias, <i>Non est species ei, neque decor; et
vidimus eum et non erat aspectus et desideravimus eum</i>:
"There is no beauty in him nor comeliness; and we
have seen him, and there was no sightliness that we
should desire him."

<h3>
VII
</h3>

<p>
Two miles outside Navares a hurrying horseman
almost collided with the head of the monks' procession.
He turned out to be a courier from Lisbon with an
urgent letter for the Prior.
</p>

<p>
Pleased to be spared the rest of the journey to the
monastery, and still better pleased with the broad coin
which the Cellarer gave him from the community's
scanty purse, the messenger delivered his package and
was about to set his horse's head homewards, without
inquiring what the monks' exodus might mean, when
Carvalho bade him halt.
</p>

<p>
"Your Reverence," said Carvalho to the Prior none
too respectfully, "I have no orders to stop letters, but
I have positive orders that your Reverences must not
attempt to harangue the people of Navares.  And I
have further orders that your Reverences must not
remain in Navares beyond noon to-morrow.  I am to
conduct all who wish it to Lisbon, where the Government
will settle the matter of the pensions of your
Reverences as soon as possible."
</p>

<p>
He showed the Prior two more sheets from the
Viscount's inexhaustible store of papers in support of
his announcement.  For a moment the Prior lost his
self-control.
</p>

<p>
"Cur!" he said.
</p>

<p>
Carvalho bowed, with the scornful smile of borrowed
power towards fallen greatness, and rode off to dispose
his men in two extended files, which could, if necessary,
envelop the monks completely.  The Prior also went
back along the line, briefly telling the news to each
pair of monks and bidding them be ready for a council
in their lodging at Navares.
</p>

<p>
As the Cellarer's kinsman, the Navares corn-merchant,
lived on the outskirts of the town, the shelter
of his house was gained before news of the monks'
arrival had reached the townspeople.  The corn-merchant
was a convinced Liberal, and something of an
anti-clerical: but he received the Cellarer's brethren
with hearty sympathy and lavish hospitality.  He
gave up to the Abbot his own room.  The beds of
clean straw which he caused to be made along the
whole length of a newly lime-washed granary were
softer than the mattresses at the monastery, and his
supper of soup and salt fish and cheese and wine was
appetizing and abundant.  Perhaps his best deed,
however, was his expulsion of Carvalho and the corporal,
who coolly walked into the granary so as to listen to
the monks' discussions.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," shouted Carvalho after the Cellarer had
convinced him that his precious papers gave him no
right to violate a private domicile, "I go: but I forbid
their Reverences to hold any kind of assembly."
</p>

<p>
"Their Reverences," retorted the corn-merchant,
who feared man even less than he feared God, "will do
as they please so long as they are in my house.  As
for your Worship, he will kindly walk out of it."
</p>

<p>
After supper the council began.  <i>Veni Creator
Spiritus</i> was sung.  Then the Prior rose, with the
letter from Lisbon in his hand, and said.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Fathers and Brethren.  God help us to bear
our many sorrows.  The courier has brought bad
news.
</p>

<p>
"For some reason, which the Visconde de Ponte
Quebrada could explain, our house was the first to be
seized.  But before many days have passed the spoilers
will possess themselves of all the houses of our Order.
We are forbidden to take counsel with any other
community of outcast religious, or to establish
ourselves in new houses.  Without God's help this is the
end of the Portuguese Benedictine congregation.
</p>

<p>
"From man we have nothing to hope.  The Government
is one of bad faith.  In my hand I have the
proofs that the earlier laws of this Spring were shams.
All the time it was intended to suppress the Orders
entirely: but the Government dared not let the people
see the thick end of the wedge.  They have revealed it
at last with fear and trembling.  Their Bill was
fathered upon one Minister alone, the Senhor Joaquim
d'Aguiar.  It was arranged that, in the event of
public indignation, the other Ministers were to repudiate
openly both the Senhor d'Aguiar and his Bill, although,
in secret, it was their joint act and deed.  Portugal
is being governed in a poisonous mist of tricks and
lies.
</p>

<p>
"But why does the Portuguese people suffer God
to be robbed and His servants thrown into the
highway without crowding to the rescue?  Alas, dear
Fathers and Brethren, I know the answer.  Our poor
land is sick of war: but there is a deeper reason why
even the most fervent Catholics will not unsheath the
sword again in our defense.  Dom Miguel deceived
them.  Just as Dom Pedro has made a sham of
Liberalism, so Dom Miguel has made a sham of piety.
Dom Miguel raised the cry of 'Throne and Altar.'  But
he cared only for the Throne.  If Saint Michael
and all the angels should descend to earth in our
defense, the Catholics of Portugal might join their
banners: but the Portuguese Catholics will not believe
again in any merely human leader.  They remember
Evora Monte.
</p>

<p>
"More: in many lands this tyranny and treachery
of the Government will be applauded and upheld.
Many lands have lent the Emperor Pedro money, and
they claim the right to influence him in secret.  The
Protestants of England will rejoice in our downfall
because we are Catholics and monks: the atheists and
Jews of France and the Low Countries because we are
Christians.  The oppression of monks will spread.
Spain, France, even Italy, will suffer.  <i>Pater dimitte
illis; non enim sciunt quid faciunt</i>: 'Father, forgive
them; they know not what they do.'"
</p>

<p>
The long room was growing dimmer while the Prior
was speaking, and when he had finished he could
hardly see the features of his auditors.  For two or
three long minutes silence blended itself with the dusk.
The livelier-minded among the monks sat still because
they felt that the Prior's words were all too true,
while the simpler souls were cowed and hushed by the
splintering of their last props of hope.
</p>

<p>
The Prior, not wishing to impose his bare opinions
upon the community, went to the window and read
aloud the long and clear letter from Lisbon which a
devout layman had made so much haste to despatch.  At
the end of his reading he called for candles; and, as
soon as they were brought, he threw the council open.
</p>

<p>
No one spoke.  All eyes were fixed on Antonio, all
ears were waiting for his words.  Amidst the prosaic
discomforts of their hot march the monks had seen the
young priest merely as one more dusty and perspiring
exile: but, after the speech of the Prior, they recovered
some of the mood in which they had listened to the
Abbot's prophecy the night before.  The scene had a
solemnity of its own.  Instead of carved stalls the
monks sat on boxes, casks, and heaps of straw: but
the few candles, casting vague shadows of black-robed
figures upon the death-white walls, filled the mind with
bodings of supernatural mystery.  One and all gazed
upon Antonio's face, fully persuaded that he would
speak and ready to obey.
</p>

<p>
Antonio, becoming conscious of their expectation,
flushed and fastened his eyes upon the ground.  The
Prior, putting into words the general feeling, said
gently:
</p>

<p>
"Father Antonio, be not afraid.  What said our
Father Saint Benedict in the Holy Rule?  <i>Ideo autem
omnes ad consilium vocari diximus; quia saepe juniori
Dominus revelat quod melius est</i>: 'We have ordained
that all be called to Council, because it is often to the
youngest that God revealeth what is best.'  Speak."
</p>

<p>
The Prior's words, the intent looks of his brethren,
the shadows, the candle-flames, the silence, seemed to
Antonio like so many hands, great and small, held out
hungrily for his words.  Besides, was it not disloyal,
mean, unbrotherly, to lock away a secret from his
brethren?  At this thought the hands came searching
and plucking in his very breast.  But the heavenly light,
which had been burning like a bright lamp within him
all day long, once more showed him his duty.  He
knew that among the monks were old men of enfeebled
mind and weakened will, whose worn wits would not be
proof against the artful pryings and questionings of
spies, and that he had no right to burden them with a
secret they could not keep.  Yet this was a minor
consideration.  The supreme fact was that God was
saying to him, "Hold thy peace."
</p>

<p>
Only when the silence had become unbearable did
Antonio answer:
</p>

<p>
"Father Prior, indulge me.  If I must speak, I crave
leave to speak last."
</p>

<p>
As affectation and false humility were faults which
had long been cast out of the community, the Prior
reluctantly took Antonio at his word.  Indeed, there
was that in the young priest's voice which compelled the
acquiescence of all.
</p>

<p>
"Then let us, Fathers and Brethren," said the Prior
at length, "speak in turn.  I will begin.  But all I shall
say is subject to alteration, nay, perhaps to complete
reversal, by the council Father Antonio shall give us."
</p>

<p>
A low murmur of approval rounded off his words.
</p>

<p>
"My own council," continued the Prior, "would be
this.  The Father Cellarer knows to a vintem how
much money we can find.  Let us, for the present,
turn our cheek to the smiter and abandon our
community life.  Let each of us decide where and how he
can best live till we have bettered or worsened our
case in Lisbon, and let him declare to the Father
Cellarer what money he will need.  For the present
Father Isidoro and Brother Cypriano and I will
remain here with our beloved Father Abbot.  He
believes"&mdash;here the Prior's voice trembled&mdash;"that God
will call his soul away to-morrow; and it is not for
us to say 'God forbid.'  But be it to-morrow, or next
week, or next month, or next year, here we stay,
Father Isidoro, Brother Cypriano and I, even though
all the horses and men in Portugal be sent to move
us.  And, when we have laid our beloved Father's
remains in the earth, I will join the Father Cellarer
in Lisbon.  We shall live in the house of the writer
of this letter, the Senhor Aureliano Gonçalves de
Sousa, the notary, in the Rua Augusta.  Let every one
of us keep in touch, one with another, at that address
until our future is clearly known."
</p>

<p>
The Cellarer spoke in the same sense.  He was
followed by the monks in turn.  Every one of them, with
varying degrees of conviction, repeated the Prior's
saving clause about Antonio's coming words, and every
one of them endorsed the Prior's counsel.
</p>

<p>
Father Isidoro and seven other choir-monks added
that their refuge would be in a house of their Order
on Spanish soil, just across the Guadiana.  It appeared
that they had been discussing the matter all day, and
that they had fixed upon this particular Spanish
monastery because it was within two hours' ride of Portugal.
Father Sebastian announced that he would take shelter
at the Inglezinhos in Lisbon.  These English Fathers,
he said, could not be suppressed because they were
secular priests and British subjects: but they had a
cloister and something of community life.  Other
monks spoke of Vigo, of Santiago de Compostela, of
Salamanca, and of a new house in Belgium where
there was a strict observance.  Two dreamed of Monte
Cassino itself, and one surprised the Council by
mentioning a Benedictine house in Protestant England, not
far from legendary Glastonbury.  Some of the oldest
Fathers named friends, clerical and lay, in various
cities of Portugal, beneath whose roofs they could die
quietly if the Prior's and the Cellarer's fight in Lisbon
should end in defeat.  As for the lay-brethren, they
decided to go in a body to Evora, where Brother
Lorenzo had claims on the protection of the Archbishop.
</p>

<p>
It was inevitable that these announcements should
generate in the Council an unmonkish excitement.
After having been so long persuaded that they would
live the rest of their lives and die their due deaths
within the same square mile of earth, there was
something strangely fascinating in this sudden unrolling of
the map of Europe.  The solid sorrow of their
dispossession was almost hidden for the moment under
a whirl and flutter of little arrangements; even as a
fatal reef is hidden under the pretty spray of the rollers
it has smashed to glittering atoms.  The buzz of talk
which followed on the more formal speaking was not
without the shrill note of schoolboys as they discuss a
thousand plans for an approaching holiday.
</p>

<p>
The Cellarer who, despite his preoccupation with its
temporals, was one of the community's most
spiritually-minded members, swiftly detected the danger.
</p>

<p>
"Father Prior," he said loudly, "all have spoken save
Father Antonio."
</p>

<p>
His bright firm voice cut through the dull buzz like
an eagle dashing through starlings, scattering them all
in flight.  Every monk felt the just rebuke, and once
more there was silence.
</p>

<p>
"Father Antonio," said the Prior, quietly and kindly.
</p>

<p>
Antonio felt that he could not speak from his place
by the wall.  He rose and advanced with bowed head
into the midst of his brethren.  The corn-merchant's
tiny candles were flickering down into their sockets;
and he waited a few moments in the hope that darkness
might enveil him before he opened his mouth.  But the
lights leaped into fuller brightness.  He raised his
head.  Everywhere he saw eyes, eyes&mdash;old eyes and
young eyes, loving eyes and stern eyes, dull eyes and
eager eyes, hopeful eyes and fearful eyes&mdash;everywhere
eyes, eyes fixed on him, Antonio, alone.
</p>

<p>
"Father Prior&mdash;" he began.  But his prepared
words were taken away.  The eyes went on piercing
him until he felt like the holy martyr Sebastian in the
midst of the sharp arrows.  At last words burst from
him.
</p>

<p>
"My Fathers, my Brethren," he cried.  "Forgive
me.  To-morrow I am going back into the world."
</p>

<p>
One of the lights went out suddenly, as if Antonio's
apostasy had struck it down like a blow.  But for five
or six seconds no one stirred or spoke.  A second
candle-flame leaped up and died away.  Then, in the
dimness, uprose a confused murmuring, sharpened here
and there by exclamations of scorn or anger or bitter
sorrow.  More distinctly than the rest was heard the
garrulous contempt of Father Bernardo, whose lapses
into the sin of gluttony had so often scandalized the
brethren.  Father Bernardo's righteous scorn was
sincere.  He had no vocation to be a saint or a hero
himself; but he knew that saints and heroes were necessary,
and he despised Antonio for turning his back upon the
light.
</p>

<p>
The Cellarer left his seat and came to Antonio's side.
Isidore and Sebastian followed him, and other monks
showed signs of doing the same.  But before a word
could be breathed into his ear, Antonio wrenched himself
out of the midst of the increasing group and threw
himself on his knees at the Prior's feet.
</p>

<p>
"For the love of Jesus Christ," he pleaded, in low
intense tones, "bid them leave me in peace."
</p>

<p>
The Prior took one of the remaining candles and
looked at Antonio intently.  At first a shade of scorn
darkened his cheek; for he imagined that he saw in
Antonio's eyes no more than the physical anguish of
a hunted animal.  But he looked more deeply; and
he saw more.
</p>

<p>
"Fathers and Brethren," he commanded.  "Let us
have order and silence.  Father Sebastian shall speak
with Father Antonio; and, after him, the Father
Cellarer.  It is time for Compline."
</p>

<p>
As everybody knew the almost invariable prayers
and psalms of Compline by heart, there was no need
for fresh candles, and the community began to recite
the office.  All had resumed their places save Antonio,
who moved slowly away to the obscurest corner, near
the granary door.  There he stood, blending his
prayers and praises with those of his brethren for the
last time.  He joined in the Confession with deep
humility, smiting his breast: and when the
Hebdomadarius gave the Absolution, Antonio crossed himself
as if Calvary itself were before his eyes.  In due time
the Psalms, the Hymn, the Little Chapter, and <i>Pater
Noster</i> had been said, and the monks began the proper
Antiphon of the Blessed Virgin, <i>Salve Regina</i>.
Repeating the pious words, Antonio quietly opened the
granary door; and, at the end of the prayer <i>Omnipotens
sempiterne Deus</i>, he slipped forth into the soft night.
</p>

<p>
Across the courtyard a light was burning in the room
where the Abbot still lay in unnatural sleep.  Antonio
drew near and gazed through the glass.  The old man's
hands were clasped on his breast, and his garment fell
into stiff folds like the alabaster draperies of a mitered
effigy on a tomb.  Antonio breathed towards the frail
body the prayer he had heard at the beginning of
Compline, <i>Noctem quietam et finem perfectum</i>: "May the
Almighty Lord grant him a quiet night and a perfect
end."
</p>

<p>
As he turned away with a bursting heart he came
face to face with Father Sebastian, who had seen his
stealthy flight.  Sebastian, as usual, was drawing his
habit closely round his body.  There was more than
usual of the consumptive glow on his cheek and of the
too bright fire in his eyes.  The two men faced each
other searchingly.
</p>

<p>
"Father Antonio," asked Sebastian at last, "is this
our Lord's work or the devil's?"
</p>

<p>
"It is our Lord's," returned Antonio in a firm voice.
"Take heed that you do not hinder it."
</p>

<p>
He brushed past and opened the wicket which led
into the high road.  But, before he passed out, he
seized his friend's thin hand in a fierce grip.
</p>

<p>
"Sebastian," he said, "ask all my brethren to forgive
me and to pray for me.  Take care of my breviary,
if you can.  Good-bye."
</p>

<p>
A sentry challenged him as he strode forth: but
Antonio threw him aside.  "I am not your prisoner,"
he said; and the fellow, bemused by wine and by
fatigue, fell back without another word.
</p>

<p>
Hurrying though Navares he contrived to pass the
apothecary's shop unobserved by the throng of leading
townsmen who were warmly debating the rights and
wrongs of the monks' case.  Outside the taverns he
was less successful; and in one instance, a lewd insult
which was flung after him led to bitter rejoinders and
a scuffle.  A young man, whose pleasant face contrasted
oddly with his words, ran after Antonio to say
that the monks ought to have been driven out long
ago: but, on the other hand, four separate men offered
him hospitality, ranging from a pull of wine to a
night's lodging.
</p>

<p>
Thanking friends and forgiving foes, the young
priest pressed forward until the last houses of Navares
were more than a league behind him.  Only then did
he sink down to rest.  His halting-place was on a more
northerly point of the long range of hills on which
stood the monastery from which he had been cast into
exile.  By the stars he knew that exactly twenty-four
hours had passed since his reverie on the cork bench,
on the flat roof of the cloister.
</p>

<p>
The airs around him, like the airs of the night before
in the monastery garden, were rich with scents of
lemon-blossom and honeysuckle.  The Atlantic still
lay unvexed by wind: but the ocean swell, as it searched
the creeks and caves, hummed heavily and wearily,
like a great bee mining in the bells of flowers that held
no honey.

<p>
Antonio slept soundly until sunrise.  When he awoke
the larks were in full song.  He sat up.  The carpet of
pine-needles around him was curiously patterned with
long black stripes&mdash;the tree-trunks' shadows cast by
the low, strong sun.  No wind moved in the wood: but
out at sea the weather seemed to have freshened, for
the chaunt of the Atlantic was quicker and louder.
</p>

<p>
The monk knelt down and said his morning prayers.
Then, obeying the call of the great waters, he arose and
struck along the margin of a maize-field towards the
shore.  In half an hour he was ankle-deep in fine
yellow sand.  But the beach fell away too steeply
and the undertow sucked too strongly for a plunge, so
he turned and plodded northward.
</p>

<p>
Two miles of toilsome going brought him to a little
estuary, about a furlong wide.  Along the further bank
sprawled a white village with a considerable tower:
but none of the villagers appeared to be astir.  The
out-flowing tide had left a deep pool of clear water.
Antonio swiftly stripped and jumped in; and only when
the level of the water had so far fallen that further
swimming was impossible did he emerge from his
bath.
</p>

<p>
Refreshed and strengthened he turned inland and
pushed up-stream until he reached a point to which
the salt water never rose.  There, in a cold cascade, he
washed his under-garments; and while they were
drying in the sun he sat under an evergreen oak,
wrapped in his coarse habit, and began to recite the
Divine Office.  Although he had perforce left behind
at Navares the bundle which contained three volumes
of his breviary, he had brought away in his hand the
<i>Pars Æstiva</i>, from which he had said the last Compline
with his brethren; and, by the time his clothes
were dry, he had recited the whole of Matins, Lauds,
and Prime.
</p>

<p>
Having dressed himself Antonio sat down to mature
his plans.  He decided, first of all, to forswear false
pride.  Excepting one volume of a breviary and the
poor clothes he sat in he was without a possession in
the world.  It was true that he owned a pair of brawny
arms, and he was willing and eager to use them hard
from morning to night: but he felt that the prime necessity
was to exchange his habit for a layman's dress.  It
was not fitting that a monk of Saint Benedict should
wander about like a mendicant friar.  Accordingly,
Antonio resolved to enter the village and to seek aid,
for the first and last time, from the secular clergy.
</p>

<p>
He waded the stream above the cascade and descended
the northern bank until he reached a lane
roughly paved with boulders.  The lane wound in and
out between low walls: but it led at last to the foot of
a mound on which rose a vast oblong church with
lime-washed walls and granite quoins.  The sacristan, in
a very short and skimpy scarlet gown, was in the act of
unlocking the doors; and, through his offices, Antonio
soon found himself in the ample presence of the
<i>padre-cura</i>.
</p>

<p>
The <i>padre-cura</i> received his visitor with uncertain
approval.  He was a hard-headed old man, whose
counsels were less eagerly sought by his flock in the
confession than in difficult cases of calving, or
boat-caulking, or bush-vine pruning.  He believed every
article of the longest and latest of the creeds implicitly,
and lived becomingly: but there was not a tinge of the
mystic in his personality.  The sight of a monk slightly
nettled him.  This secular priest felt that a religious
must be contemptuous of his common-sense, every-day
Christianity, and that he must be tacitly challenging
him to a superfine and unpractical piety.  Besides, the
cura's friends were Liberals, and they had quieted his
qualms concerning the new laws against the monasteries
by assuring him, as they assured so many others of his
class, that the swollen revenues of the suppressed houses
would go to augment the wretched stipends of the
rural clergy.
</p>

<p>
Antonio began to explain whence he had come.  But
the sacristan was already tugging away at the bell-rope,
and the cura interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"You are not a lay-brother?" he demanded.  "You
are a priest?"
</p>

<p>
"I am a priest," answered Antonio.
</p>

<p>
"Then you shall say my Mass," said the cura
promptly.  "We will talk about your business at
breakfast."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot say your Mass, Father," responded
Antonio, flushing sadly.  "I was ordained priest only
forty-eight hours ago, and yesterday morning we were
driven from the abbey.  God alone knows when and
where my first Mass will be said."
</p>

<p>
The old cura's heart melted towards the young monk.
Unmystical though he was, he recalled the high mood
of his own ordination day, the fine happiness of his
own first Mass.  He laid his rough hand kindly on
Antonio's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Come," he said, "if you can't say my Mass, at least
you shall serve it."
</p>

<p>
Antonio served the cura's Mass at a gilded altar,
tricked out with gaudy vases of faded crimson paper
roses in the very worst taste he had ever seen.  But the
old priest, despite the nasality of his Latin and the
jerkiness of his genuflexions, said Mass with an
intensity of recollection which edified the server
exceedingly; and the few peasants who knelt on the boarded
floor were not behind him in devotion.
</p>

<p>
The cura's breakfast was enlarged in Antonio's
honor.  Over and above the inevitable bacalhau, or
salted stock-fish, there was a whole hake.  It had been
caught only half a dozen hours before, and it made a
fine show with its head and tail projecting over the
ends of a long rough dish, gaily painted with birds and
flowers.  There was also a piled-up mess of boiled beef
and ham sausage, banked on rice and white cabbage
and moated round with a broth full of chick-peas.
Each breakfaster was also served with a couple of eggs,
fried in olive oil; and the meal was rounded off by
a basket of late strawberries.  To wash down the solids
the cura opened three bottles of sharp green wine.
</p>

<p>
Antonio ate and drank sparingly.  During the meal
he confined himself to answering his host's innumerable
questions, and listening, without resentment, to sly
hints about monkish arrogance and luxury: but while
the cura was busy with his strawberries, he told simply
and shortly the tale of the alien Visconde de Ponte
Quebrada.  As he ceased speaking he saw that the old
man was half won round to the monks' side.
</p>

<p>
"And now, what are you going to do?" asked the cura.
</p>

<p>
"For the present," said Antonio, "I am going back
into the world.  I will be a burden upon none.  I am
going to work; and, when I have put a little money by,
I have a plan of doing something for my Order."
</p>

<p>
"What can you do for a living?"
</p>

<p>
"I understand vines and wine.  At the abbey I had
charge of the vineyard."
</p>

<p>
"You are making your way to Oporto?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  To Oporto."
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  I sell two pipes of green wine every
year to a firm there.  I will give you a letter.  But
what about your clothes?  You can't go back into the
world like this."
</p>

<p>
"I sought you this morning, Father," said Antonio
with a great effort, "for this very reason."
</p>

<p>
"How much money have you?"
</p>

<p>
"Not any, Father.  Beyond one volume of my
breviary and the clothes you see me wearing, I have
nothing in this world."
</p>

<p>
The old man emitted his amazement in a protracted,
clucking noise.  Then he rose abruptly and
commanded:
</p>

<p>
"Come with me."
</p>

<p>
In an otherwise empty room at the head of the stairs
stood a large clothes-press.  As the cura threw open its
doors a waft of camphor and lavender filled Antonio's
nostrils.  Unfolding some linen wrappers the cura took
out a suit of black clothes, such as country tailors
make for doctors and lawyers and officials.
</p>

<p>
"I have worn these clothes twice," said the cura,
"once at the Bishop's funeral and once at my niece's
wedding.  Ah, my friend, I was a man in those days,
not a shrimp.  That was before I had my fever.  I
could eat a dinner with any man in the diocese; yes,
and empty a bottle too.  But since I've lost my appetite
and come down to skin and bone, what good are these
clothes to me?  They'd flap about on me like a sack
on a scarecrow.  Take them, my son, and a good
riddance to them."
</p>

<p>
As the cura had just consumed fully three pounds'
weight of bacalhau, hake, beef, vegetables, and dark
bread, to say nothing of the strawberries and the eggs,
Antonio's gravity was shaken.  His host was still so
rosy and rotund that the young monk dared not picture
him as he must have been before he sank to his shrimp-like
and skin-and-bone condition.  But it was only for
a moment that he found the old man ridiculous.  The
main thing was that he was relieving Antonio's need
with a tact as beautiful as his generosity.
</p>

<p>
The cura went to the window while Antonio donned
the clothes.  They fitted him ill, but not intolerably.
Indeed, the cura, when he turned round, affirmed that
there was not a tailor in Lisbon itself who could have
fitted Antonio better.  There was a difficulty about a
hat, the monk's head being larger than the cura's;
and it was finally agreed that a decent hat must be
dispensed with until the traveler reached the nearest
town, and that an improvisation of straw or grass must
meanwhile serve in its stead.
</p>

<p>
Leading the way to his bedroom the old man
unlocked a large coffer of chestnut-wood, and drew up
from its depths a tarnished silver snuff-box.  Within
the snuff-box nestled a tiny leather pouch.  The cura
shook its contents into his left palm.  Altogether
there were eleven pieces of English gold, seven whole
sovereigns and four halves.  Such English pounds,
<i>libras esterlinas</i>, and "half-pounds" were almost the
sole gold currency in Portugal.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to lend you five pounds," said the cura.
"If you can save enough to repay it while I am alive,
so much the better.  If you can do nothing till after I
am dead, have Masses said for my soul.  Here, take it,
my son, and God bless you."
</p>

<p>
So big a lump swelled in Antonio's throat that it was
a long time before he could answer.  At last he managed
to utter his thanks and to declare stoutly that he
would accept one pound only, to be repaid within the
year.  The cura grew angry, but the monk was firm.
After much argument the dispute was ended by
Antonio's accepting two half-pounds in English gold and
a further half-pound in Portuguese <i>tostões</i> and <i>vintens</i>.*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* The Portuguese <i>real</i> (plural <i>reis</i>) is an imaginary coin.
Twenty <i>reis</i> make one <i>vintem</i> (plural <i>vintens</i>) the Portuguese
penny.  One hundred <i>reis</i>, or five <i>vintems</i> made one <i>tostão</i>
(plural <i>tostões</i>).  The large silver piece called <i>mil reis</i> (1000
<i>reis</i>) is nominally worth 4<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>, but is practically a dollar.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
By this time the sun was pouring down floods of fire
from the heights of heaven.  The cura closed the
shutters and insisted that Antonio should rest on his bed
till the fiercest heat should be passed.  He himself
descended to the living-room to say his Office and to
indite the letter to the Operto wine-merchants&mdash;an
unfamiliar and formidable task, which was only
achieved after two hours of grunting and groaning and
ink-spilling and striding about.
</p>

<p>
Lying on the straw-stuffed bed, with his head on a
hard pillow less than ten inches square, Antonio tried
to recall all that had happened since the clink of steel
cut short his reverie on the roof of the cloister.  But
out of forty-eight hours he had slept barely five.
Drowsiness crept over him, and he fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
When he awoke and opened the shutters he knew by
the sun that it must be about five o'clock in the
afternoon.  He hastened downstairs.  A smell of salt fish
and warmed-up beef and hot oil prepared him for the
cura's pressing invitation to stay to dinner, which he
gratefully and decisively refused.
</p>

<p>
At the presbytery door a handsome young peasant,
goad in hand, was waiting alongside a pair of bullocks
and a cart.  The bullocks, fawn-colored, with great
soft eyes, had horns a yard long.  The cart was of a
type unchanged since the days of the Romans.  The
wheels were simply iron-bound disks of wood cut in
one piece from the round trunks of big trees: the cart
itself was stuck round with a dozen upright staves, to
fence in the load.
</p>

<p>
Wringing his benefactor's hand for the seventh time
and uttering a final word of gratitude, Antonio was
about to begin his march when the peasant came forward
to help him into the cart.  It was vain to protest.
The cura, who had never walked three continuous
leagues in his life, laughed to scorn the monk's earnest
declaration that he preferred to go afoot.  The cart,
he said, was hired and paid for as far as the nearest
town, and he was not going to have a thousand reis
thrown away.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing for it but obedience.  The peasant
had softened the rigors of the vehicle by flinging
in a heap of heather and bracken: and as soon as his
passenger was stretched full length on the greenery he
made haste to rig up an awning on the poles.  This
consisted of one of the huge waterproofs, plaited from
reeds or grass, in which the Portuguese peasantry walk
about on rainy days looking like animated Kaffir huts.
The son of Saint Benedict winced at so much pampering:
but the cura was not to be withstood.
</p>

<p>
As the bullocks began to slouch forward Antonio
felt some kind of a package being thrust through the
bars behind his head, while a rough voice muttered in
his ear:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Adeus</i>!  And pray to God for an old sinner!"
</p>

<p>
The peasant gently plied the goad, and the bullocks
quickened their pace to about two miles an hour.
Fortunately the road was deserted, and no one met or
overtook the chariot.  At the first turning Antonio's
impulse to leap out and walk was nearly irresistible;
but respect for the cura restrained him.  Leaning on
one elbow he opened his breviary and recited the
remainder of the day's Office as far as the end of Vespers.
This done, he could tolerate his position no longer.
The jolting of the rigid cart over an ill-made and worse
mended road, and the skriking of the unoiled axle, he
might have endured: but the snail's pace, and, worst
of all, the feeling that he was like a fatted beast in the
pen on the way to a fair, chafed him beyond bearing.
So at sunset he descended, and, giving the driver one
of his tostões, declared that he would complete the
journey on foot.  For five minutes the peasant
obstinately insisted on marching with his passenger, cart
and bullocks and all, as far as the town: but this the
monk, fearful of being led to an inn where he would
have to spend more tostões, would not allow.  The
peasant gave way at last; and, placing in Antonio's
hand the packet which the cura had thrust between the
bars of the cart, he wished him God-speed, and turned
his clumsy beasts and creaking machine back towards
the south.
</p>

<p>
With legs half-paralyzed by the cramping cart and
sadly encumbered by his unfamiliar clothes, Antonio's
first steps were like those of a drunken man.  But he
soon got into his stride and reached the town before
the shops were closed.  The felt sombrero which he
bought amidst an increasing crowd of gaping idlers
was the cheapest he could find: but it left him less
change than he expected out of one of his half-pounds.
Outside the shop a brown-eyed, bare-footed boy was
waiting to guide the stranger to the inn; but Antonio
gave him a vintem and pressed forward on his journey.
</p>

<p>
About an hour before midnight he reached a moss-grown
aqueduct which supplied the water-wheel of a
lonely orangery.  Climbing the bank from which its
clear spring gushed forth, the tired wayfarer sat down
on the warm stones and opened the cura's package.  It
held a bottle of green wine, a loaf of rye bread, and
some hunks of cold boiled beef; also, wrapped up in
many wrappings, one more English pound.
</p>

<p>
Tears came into the monk's eyes.  Throughout the
griefs and partings of the two days just past he had
been dry-eyed and calm: but this was beyond bearing.
Mechanically holding open in his hand the book which
it was too dark to read, he recited Compline, adding a
heartfelt supplication for the cura's good estate.  Then
he ate a little of the dark bread, drank a few cool
draughts from the hurrying spring, and lay down to
sleep.
</p>

<p>
Before slumber had fully sealed his eyelids some
sudden influence roused Antonio up.  As plainly as if
an angel's voice had spoken, he knew that in that
moment the soul of the Abbot had passed to God.  He
arose and sank upon his knees, devoutly offering
fervent prayers.  Then he lay down once more, strangely
filled with peace and with a feeling that all was well.
He could not sleep; but he lay looking up into the
violet heavens as though he half expected to see
appearing in their highest heights a new bright star.
</p>

<h3>
II
</h3>

<p>
June morn after June morn, June eve after June eve,
Antonio steadily tramped towards Oporto.  He usually
rested in some grove or on the seashore from nightfall
until dawn, and from about ten in the morning until
four in the afternoon: but he was rarely on the march
less than twelve hours a day.
</p>

<p>
Jealously guarding his little hoard he never spent a
vintem that he could fairly save.  For example, as he
approached the mouth of the Mondego, he learned that
the ferryman expected a pataco for the passage.  A
pataco is two vintens: so Antonio made a detour to
the east and swam the stream at a lonely spot, pushing
his clothes before him on a tiny raft of osiers.  The
cura's beef and bread and wine fed him for two days,
and when they were consumed the monk lived on a
tostão a day.  His food was mainly dark bread; but
he allowed himself, morning and evening, a small
goat's-milk cheese and a draught of wine at a roadside
tavern, for which he paid one pataco, or sometimes less.
Once he caught two trout in a wayside stream, taking
them with his hand from a pool as he had learned to
do as a boy.  A bit of a broken horseshoe and a flint
enabled him to kindle a cook's fire in a little hollow.
</p>

<p>
In the plain to the west of Bussaco a farmer whom
he overtook on the road from Coimbra gave him two
days' work in his vineyard, for which he paid Antonio
five tostões and his board.  Again, at Aveiro, a young
canon who had surprised the monk conning his breviary
in a dim corner of the insignificant cathedral, not only
forced upon him a dinner and a night's lodging, but
took him next morning aboard a kind of gondola which
bore him along a Venetian-looking canal all the way to
Ovar.  From Ovar Antonio made a forced march of
twenty miles; and that night he slept on sand, under
pines, close to the mouth of the Douro.  At daybreak
he turned inland in time to see the first rays of the sun
striking the tower of the Clerigos and the piled-up
white houses of Oporto.
</p>

<p>
With the flashing Douro between himself and the
city, he took out the cura's unsealed letter to the
wine-merchant and read it for the twentieth time.  The
perusal strengthened his conviction that he could not
present it.  Throughout three pages the cura enlarged
upon his young friend's troubles as an expelled monk:
and this was not the light in which Antonio wished the
employers of Oporto to regard him.
</p>

<p>
Descending into Villa Nova de Gaia, he was surprised
and delighted to find that he was already among
the warehouses and caves of the more famous
wine-merchants, and that he did not need to cross the bridge
of boats in order to begin his search for employment.
But as it was still too early for the magnates to have
reached their bureaux, he determined to hear Mass.
On a height above him rose a fine domed church, and
thither he climbed.  Antonio did not know that he was
gazing upon the famous Augustinian convent of Nossa
Senhora da Serra do Pilar, whence the Duke of
Wellington, helped by monks, had made his wonderful dash
across the Douro five-and-thirty years before; nor did
he know that less than two years had passed since the
gallant Liberal Marquis Sa da Bandeira had held the
same spot against heavy Miguelista odds.  What
engrossed Antonio was the confusion, which showed that
this convent was faring little better than his own abbey
and that the Augustinians were faring no better than
the Benedictines.  He waited for Mass in vain.
</p>

<p>
Dropping down again into Gaia he bought a piece of
bread and turned into a tavern for a short rest and a
draught of wine.  When the tavern-keeper was
inquisitive Antonio candidly stated that he had come to
Gaia to look for employment.  The tavern-keeper
shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Your Worship has come at the wrong time," he
said.  And he went on to tell how one of the French
soldiers of fortune, who had been hired for the siege,
had wantonly destroyed nine thousand pipes of wine in
a single warehouse.  The port-wine trade, he said, was
all at sixes and sevens.
</p>

<p>
A little daunted, Antonio arose at last and made his
way to the first of the warehouses.  Like many others
which he visited in the course of the day, it was
protected by a small representation of the Union Jack,
painted correctly in red, white, and blue, and
superscribed, "British Property."  An English foreman
barred Antonio's way to the office with a surly
announcement that the manager had not arrived, and
that in no case were new hands required.  At the
second warehouse he was less curtly but no more usefully
answered.  At the third and fourth he was denied
admittance.  At the fifth he would have been given a
temporary post had he been able to speak English: but
the monk could only read and write it.  At the
eleventh and last he was told that he might apply again
in a week's time.
</p>

<p>
With weary limbs and a wearier heart the wanderer
crossed the bridge of boats in the blaze of the June
afternoon and toiled up the hill to the cathedral.  In
the granite cloisters, face to face with some unchurchly
azulejos depicting scenes from the Song of Solomon,
he sat with closed eyes until the heat was passed.  Then
he descended one hill and ascended another in search
of the great Benedictine monastery.  He found the
community still in possession: but an inward voice
forbade him to make himself known and he turned
sadly away.
</p>

<p>
Many broken windows and a few wrecked houses
reminded Antonio of the siege so lately ended; but,
on the whole, he was surprised to see so few signs of
the strife.  The streets were full of bullock-carts,
fishwives, and busy people of all sorts, and the river was
alive with shipping.  Amidst so much activity surely
the morrow would find a post for him to fill.  He
plucked up heart and set about securing a cheap
lodging.  Happily the first he inspected met his needs.
For six tostões a week he hired a narrow room over a
cobbler's, with the right to use the cobbler's wife's fire
twice a day.
</p>

<p>
In order that he might pick up the manners and
speech of the world, Antonio dined that night in a
quay-side eating-house.  Throughout the meal he
heard little more than a loud conversation between a
Norwegian captain and his mate: but while he was
lingering at the table, lamenting the wasting of twelve
vintens, three or four Portuguese entered and sat
down at the table of the departing Norwegians.  In
audible tones they continued a debate in which they
were engaged on the suppression of the religious
orders.  They were coarsened men, whose language
was one-fourth oaths.
</p>

<p>
As one monstrous slander after another was uttered
against his brethren, Antonio's blood began to boil
within him.  Very little more would have overborne
his self-control: but suddenly a black-mustached man
with the Lisbon accent, who had taken a minor part
in the argument, rapped the table and made himself
heard.
</p>

<p>
"Monks and friars are wastrels and loafers," he
began, "but the men who're turning them out are ten
times worse.  Listen to me.  I'll tell your Worships
what everybody was talking about in Lisbon the day
before yesterday, when I came away."
</p>

<p>
Through the waiter setting down the newcomers'
plates with a noisy rattle, Antonio lost most of the next
sentence: but, with a start of surprise, he caught the
name of his own abbey.
</p>

<p>
"It's only a little abbey," continued the man from
Lisbon, "and nobody guessed it was so rich.  But it
seems the monks had got stuff worth a hundred thousand
pounds.  They had dozens of golden cups all
covered over with diamonds as big as pigeons' eggs,
and a lot of pictures by the famous Italian painter
Raphael.
</p>

<p>
"Your Worships have heard of our new Viscount,
the Viscount of Ponte Quebrada.  He comes from
Amsterdam, or London, or Frankfort&mdash;it doesn't
matter which.  He's a Jew, or an atheist, or a
Protestant&mdash;it's all the same thing.  The Government has
made him a Viscount because he found money last
year.  For every thirty English pounds he brought,
Portugal has to pay back a hundred, and the interest
as well.  So he's been made a Viscount."
</p>

<p>
"We're not Miguelistas here," growled one of the
company.  But the Lisbon man ignored him and went on:
</p>

<p>
"Somehow the Viscount of Ponte Quebrada got
wind of the diamond cups.  He went off himself with
the troopers, so that he could lay hold of them for
himself.  I know exactly what happened.  My brother
employs a man whose cousin was one of the soldiers.
When the Viscount demanded possession of the
monastery, the monks insisted that he should give receipts
for all the pictures and cups.  There was a terrible
quarrel.  Then the Viscount tried to steal the things
in the night.  But he was caught.  The next morning
it turned out that the Prior was really a general,
and that he had been second in command to the famous
Wellington.  He threw off his monk's dress before
all the soldiers and stood up in full uniform, and
offered to fight the Viscount either with swords or
pistols.  Then the Viscount signed the receipts.
</p>

<p>
"As soon as the monks had passed out of the gates,
the Abbot, who was nearly a hundred years old,
dropped down dead from the excitement.  When they
buried him, at a place called Navares, there was nearly
a riot against the Government."
</p>

<p>
"I tell you, we are not against the Government here,"
gruffed out the Oporto man with increasing resentment.
But the Lisbon man ignored him again.
</p>

<p>
"The Viscount sent all the soldiers to this place
Navares, to put the riot down.  Then he pretended to
be afraid that the Prior was going to make a dash back
for the diamond cups: so he pretended to bury them
in the woods, and sent an express to the Government
to come with half a regiment and carry the stuff safely
to Lisbon.  The Government sent fifty more soldiers:
but, when the Viscount took them to the place in the
woods, all they found was an empty hole."
</p>

<p>
Even the Oporto Liberal whistled his surprise.
Antonio, bending forward unconsciously, strained his
ears to catch every word.
</p>

<p>
"They say," concluded the man from Lisbon, "that
no play-actor in the world could have done better than
the Viscount.  When he saw the empty hole he threw
up his hands and began raving like a madman, and tore
his hair.  But nobody is taken in.  He has stormed
and raged and threatened: but Lisbon's too hot for
him, and he's taken himself off on an English
packet."
</p>

<p>
"And the diamond cups?" demanded two voices at once.
</p>

<p>
"Don't ask me," chuckled the man from Lisbon.
"Ask the Viscount of Ponte Quebrada.  After all,
what does it matter?  Portugal has been robbed a
thousand times before, and this is simply the thousand
and first.  As I've said already, friars and monks are
loafers and wastrels; but they're being driven out by
knaves and thieves."
</p>

<p>
"The whole tale's a pack of lies!" roared the Oporto
Liberal.  And, rising up, he banged the table with his
fist until the wine leaped out of the glasses.
</p>

<p>
The Lisbon man, who had told his tale in bantering,
almost jovial tones, sprang up in his turn and blazed
out with a brace of lurid oaths.  In a moment the
whole place was in an uproar and things looked ugly
for the Southerner.  But just as the first blow was
about to be struck Antonio leaped between the combatants.
</p>

<p>
"Senhores," he cried, "the whole tale is not a pack of
lies.  I used to work for that old Abbot in the monks'
vineyards.  It is true that the Viscount of Ponte
Quebrada tried to seize the abbey's treasures for himself."
</p>

<p>
For two or three seconds everybody stared at Antonio
in speechless surprise.  Then the din of angry voices
broke out louder than ever.  The tavern-keeper bawled
out commands which no one heeded, while threats and
curses filled the air.  From other tables excited men
came hurrying to the fray.
</p>

<p>
Antonio saw that the odds were a dozen to two: so
he gripped the man from Lisbon by the shoulders and
half shoved, half swung him to the open door and into
the safety of the street.  And, in spite of being well
cursed and hustled for his pains, he did not relax his
hold until they had gained a dim and quiet alley.
</p>

<p>
When Antonio said good-night and would have
turned homeward, the Southerner had the grace and
sense to know that a service had been rendered to him.
Rather sulkily he grunted:
</p>

<p>
"Stop.  One moment.  You meant well.  Who are you?"
</p>

<p>
"My name," answered the monk, "is Francisco
Manoel Oliveira da Rocha."  It was Antonio's true
name, but from long disuse it came haltingly from his
lips.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing in Oporto?"
</p>

<p>
"Looking for work," said Antonio.  "I only arrived
this morning.  Perhaps I shall have better luck
to-morrow.  In Gaia the wine-merchants do not want
hands."
</p>

<p>
"That's all stuff and nonsense!" snorted the man
from Lisbon.  "They want a man badly at the cellars
of Castro and de Mattos."
</p>

<p>
Antonio explained that he had approached the Senhores
Castro and de Mattos and had been turned out.
</p>

<p>
"Meet me outside their offices at nine to-morrow
morning," said the stranger, "and they'll let you in."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0203"></a></p>

<h3>
III
</h3>

<p>
Not only the next morning, but also on hundreds
of mornings following, Castro's and de Mattos'
doors opened to Antonio.  Somewhat straitened
financially, Senhor Castro, the only surviving partner, was
coquetting with a rich English wine-merchant who
wished to acquire a direct interest in an Oporto
wine-lodge of repute.  The negotiations demanded an exact
stock-taking, and to this end Antonio was engaged for
three months at a wage of four milreis a week.
</p>

<p>
The hours were long and the work was heavy.  Two
porters were at his disposal; but Antonio had often to
put his own shoulder to the shifting of a cask.  As for
the brain-work it was harder than the manual.
Following Portuguese custom the Castro wines had been
reckoned by weight; and it was the young monk's duty
to work out difficult sums in weights and measures,
transmuting the awkward Portuguese almudes into
equally awkward English tuns and hogsheads.
</p>

<p>
On the last day of July, more than four weeks before
anybody expected the work to be finished, Antonio
placed a neatly-written summary in his employer's
hands.  Senhor Castro was delighted.  Not only was
he able to resume his negotiations a month earlier than
he had hoped, but his losses during the siege proved to
be less than he had feared.  Recalling the strenuous
Antonio to his private room he renewed his engagement,
and entrusted him with important duties far up
the Douro, where the Castro vineyards lay.
</p>

<p>
Throughout a torrid August, in a profound gorge
where the quivering heat abode like fiery vapors in a
crater, Antonio labored on, tightening the lax Castro
discipline and overhauling the muddled organization.
Before the feast of Saint Michael and All Angels the
vintage was over, and an unusual quantity of good
wine had been pressed with exceptional care.  The
monk returned to Oporto in a wine-boat, and his
voyage was not without excitements.  Here swirling
through a deep ravine, there spreading over wide
shallows, the Douro kept its navigators ever on the alert.
Once, at sunrise, a bark which was outstripping
Antonio's came to grief.  Two hogsheads of wine
smashed like egg-shells against a jagged reef of slate,
and the chocolate-colored water was empurpled with
the spilt blood of the vine.
</p>

<p>
On reporting himself to Senhor Castro Antonio
found his hours shortened, his importance heightened,
and his salary raised to twenty-five milreis a month.
But he did not abandon his cheap lodging over the
cobbler's shop nor did he soften the austerities of his life.
By the beginning of October, continued self-denial
enabled him to send to the old cura five English pounds
in return for the clothes and money which had started
the monk on his secular career.
</p>

<p>
Antonio's were strenuous days.  In the cellar and in
the counting-house he gave his whole body and mind
to his work.  Yet he performed every day the Work of
God.  Soon after the disappearance of his Benedictine
brethren from their convent in Oporto, he saw in a
poor shop a complete monastic breviary which he
bought for a few coppers.  Every morning, week-day
and Sunday, he heard Mass, and every day he recited
the whole of the Divine Office.  And over and above
all this he found time for perfecting himself in spoken
and written English.  A swim and a long tramp on a
Sunday, followed by a meal in a tavern, were his sole
pleasures; and his Sunday evenings were cheerfully
sacrificed to the needs of Oporto's poor and illiterate
Gallegos, or Spanish porters from Galicia, whose
letters to their friends at home were often written by
Antonio's pen.
</p>

<p>
At the Whitsuntide holidays he would tramp off to
the shrine of Bom Jesus, or Our Lord of the Mount, on
a hill overlooking the primatial city of Braga.  There
he would eat the penny stews and halfpenny loaves,
cooked for the pilgrims in the great hill-side ovens, and
after a farthing draught of wine he would lie down to
sleep in the open air.
</p>

<p>
After three years of this kind of life, in which each
new week was almost a replica of the week before,
Antonio found himself with a hundred English pounds.
He had saved it by laying vintem on vintem, milreis
on milreis.  But he needed two hundred for the
execution of his plan.  The dreary prospect of three more
grinding years, during which his opportunity might
vanish away, suddenly dismayed him; and, falling on
his knees in the ancient little church of Cedofeita, he
desperately challenged heaven to make haste.
</p>

<p>
Two hours later Senhor Castro summoned the young
man to his presence.  He said that the quickly-waxing
repute of the firm's ports in England had led to a large
order for the cellars of the English king.  His London
partner, he added, was rising to the occasion, and had
already chartered a small ship for the transport of the
juice.  The idea was that no one outside the firm's own
staff should handle the wine throughout its voyage
from the Castro warehouses to King William's cellars.
Senhor Castro concluded by asking Antonio to take
entire charge of the affair.  Nothing was said about an
increase in his salary, but he was to receive a special
allowance of four pounds a week for traveling expenses
from the moment of dropping anchor in the Thames
until he landed again in Oporto.
</p>

<p>
Antonio thanked his employer warmly; but the
secret places of the monk's heart were loud with still
warmer thanks to the Lord.  He swiftly reckoned that
the journey would increase his little hoard by not less
than thirty pounds.  Besides, he would see England in
the full beauty of her famous spring and summer.  He
would tread the pavements of the greatest city in the
world.  Best of all he would hear and speak nothing
but the English tongue which he had worked so hard
to master.
</p>

<p>
As he walked out of the chief's office and gazed
across the familiar river to the blinding whiteness of
Oporto, Antonio suddenly realized that his good
fortune had not befallen him a day too soon.  During his
daily, weekly, monthly plodding at a routine of dogged
overwork he had not perceived that he was drawing
away his reserves of health and courage.  But, all in a
moment, the unutterable staleness of his duties and
surroundings sickened him.  He shrank back from the
torrid glare into a patch of shade and gasped greedily
for air, like a newly-caught fish.  Until he recovered
self-control it seemed impossible to wait another
moment for the waters and fresh breezes of the Atlantic,
and for the green meadows and cool glades of England.
</p>

<p>
Ten mornings later the <i>Queen of the Medway</i>, with
Antonio and his precious pipes of port on board,
dropped down the Douro on a strong ebb-tide.  A
gentle wind blew favorably from the south, and before
sunset the schooner had lost sight of Monte Luzia, the
holy hill which watches over the towers and roofs of
Vianna do Castello.  As the last lights faded Antonio
almost made out through the captain's glasses the
mouth of the little river which divides Portugal from
Spain.  At daybreak the wind freshened and the monk,
climbing the ladder with difficulty, peeped out at the
arid peaks of Galicia.  His next three days were less
happy, for the Bay of Biscay was not in one of its
softer moods.
</p>

<p>
Turning round Ushant, the <i>Queen of the Medway</i>
swam as gently as a swan into summer seas.  The wind,
after veering round to the west, had weakened into the
softest of zephyrs, so that the log during the voyage
up Channel never showed more than fifty knots a day.
But Antonio inwardly gave thanks.  At the first sight
of Brittany his sea-sickness ceased.  He began to eat
like a hunter and to sleep like a log.  In his portmanteau
were English books and a grammar; but, outside
the Divine Office, he did not read a word.  For nine or
ten hours a day he lay full-length on the deck, basking
in the temperate sunshine while the immense tranquillity
of sky and sea healed his nerves, and the soft air
bought back color to his cheeks and light to his eyes.
</p>

<p>
The snow-white precipices of the English coast, and
especially Shakespeare's Cliff, were so unlike anything
he had ever seen before that they would have stirred
Antonio even if there had been nothing within him of
the poet and the student.  But as they gave place to
the flat beaches of Whitstable and the earth-banks of
Sheppey he forgot the white walls in his eagerness to
see the wonders they guarded.  With the rosy breaking
of the sixteenth day of the voyage he was already
on the deck scanning the banks of the Thames.  The
chill landscape looked un-English and reminded him of
Dutch pictures.
</p>

<p>
As day broadened the Thames narrowed.  Many
ships, great and small, came closer to the <i>Queen of the
Medway</i> as she moved forward with the flowing tide.
Suddenly a frigate, pushing seaward against the stream,
set the Thames on fire with curiosity.  Her flag was
flying at half-mast.  A minute later the incoming craft
had read her signals.  King William was dead.
</p>

<p>
The captain, the mate, and Antonio uncovered; and,
rather tardily, the crew did the same.  A big East
Indiaman, just ahead, began firing signal-guns in an
aimless way, while a small collier half-masted a grimy
Union Jack of incorrect design.  If all the ships'
companies were like the crew of the <i>Queen of the Medway</i>,
there was much less grief than excitement.  Even
Antonio, who immediately went below with a troubled
face, was selfish in his regrets.  Now King William
was dead, would the new King take the pipes of port?
</p>

<p>
Mr. Austin Crowberry, Senhor Castro's London
partner, was not at the wharf when the <i>Queen of the
Medway</i> made fast.  But Antonio had no trouble.  As
the cargo was wholly for the King it was not subject
to customs-duties, and the formalities were completed
in a few moments.  Indeed, one high official of the
Excise was so anxious to be obliging that he strove
hard to carry Antonio off to dine at a famous tavern.
</p>

<p>
When Mr. Crowberry arrived at last it was evident
that he had been honoring the Castro juices with his
active patronage.  He recognized Antonio, whom he
had seen twice in Gaia, and shook him so warmly by
the hand that it was no longer possible to doubt his
exhilarated condition.  He would have drunk two
bottles more in the captain's cabin if Antonio had not
schemed to show him an empty cupboard.  Very soon
he lost his temper and launched into imprudent and
disloyal grumblings.  The House of Hanover, he said,
was a house of spendthrifts and madmen.  Who but
a madman, he demanded of Antonio point-blank,
would go and die on the very eve of filling his cellar
with Waterloo port?  And who was this chit Victoria?
She was a slip of a wench nobody had ever heard of.
He wound up by thanking his stars that he had only
one child, seeing that the country could not possibly
last another ten years.
</p>

<p>
Like the gorgeous officer of the Excise, Mr. Austin
Crowberry tried his best to drag Antonio away to a
tavern.  But the monk stood firm.  Until some officer
of the royal household should take the cargo off his
hands, not Senhor Castro himself could have induced
him to leave the <i>Queen of the Medway</i> for a moment.
His quarters were narrow, the deck was malodorous:
but Antonio stuck to his post.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0204"></a></p>

<h3>
IV
</h3>

<p>
Under a heat which amazed Antonio the quays and
the dock became more unsavory every day: but he did
not quit the <i>Queen of the Medway</i>.  His friend the
Excise officer agreed with Mr. Crowberry that decency
required patient waiting until after the King's funeral.
Meanwhile, however, the dock charges and other
expenses were running on.  Accordingly, Antonio drafted
a discreet and respectful letter to the comptroller of
the royal cellars, asking him to affix seals to a small
bonded warehouse in which the wine could await his
convenience.  Mr. Crowberry admired and signed the
letter and despatched it through a privileged middleman.
The comptroller's people accepted the proposal
with surprising alacrity; and within a week of his
reaching London the cargo lay safely under lock and
seal and Antonio was free.
</p>

<p>
Through pure thoughtlessness Mr. Crowberry
recommended Antonio to a hostelry where his expenses
were a pound a day.  After one night's stay he quitted
these noisy and expensive quarters for a modest
lodging within sight of green fields, up Tottenham Court
Road.  At first English habits upset him.  He tried
both beer and porter, and could not decide which was
the more undesirable.  The clarets, and even the ports,
which he tasted at Mr. Crowberry's were heavy and all
wrong.  The saddles of mutton, the sirloins of beef
and the boiled salmon were supremely excellent: but,
on the whole, Antonio could not divine why the wealthy
and table-loving English fed so unwisely and so unwell.
</p>

<p>
Mingling with a good-humored Cockney crowd, who
made room for "the Dago," Antonio saw the funeral
procession of the King.  He found the state-coaches
much inferior to those he had seen in Lisbon: but the
military pageant was beyond everything he had
imagined.  His chief thrill, however, went through him
at the sight of the Duke of Wellington, whom a young
Cockney, with vague notions concerning the Peninsular
War, pointed out to Antonio as "the good old Djook
wot beat yer 'oller."  Antonio was much more deeply
moved by the figure of the veteran warrior than by the
gorgeously empalled royal coffin.  He had heard many
an evil word against the Iron Duke and against the
cynical selfishness of England in making poor Portugal
her cat's paw under a guise of magnanimity: but he
instinctively uncovered as the grand old soldier rode by.
</p>

<p>
A more indefatigable sightseer than Antonio never
descended upon the monuments and public collections
of London.  He saw every notable object once, and
the worthier sights many times over.  The pictures
overpowered him.  As for the churches, he entered
every one of the few that were open: but Wren's
buildings to Antonio, like Lisbon's churches to an
Englishman, seemed nearly all alike.
</p>

<p>
He heard Mass every morning at the lumbering
Sardinian Chapel, near Lincoln's Inn Fields.  He also
visited the new Catholic church called St. Mary
Moorfields, of which the London Papists were immensely
proud: but he thought it poor and small.  Now and
again he attended, without assisting <i>in sacris</i>, some
Protestant services.  At the first of them he heard a
City incumbent harangue a somnolent congregation of
twelve against the idolatrous practice of setting up
images in churches: but Antonio was more bewildered
than edified, because the very small communion-table
was overtopped by a very large image of a lion assisting
a very large image of a unicorn to sustain the royal
arms.  In the too bare Saint Paul's Cathedral and the
too much encumbered Westminster Abbey he heard
organ-playing and anthem-singing beautiful beyond his
dreams: but he could not understand why the Church
of England should have renounced the Mass while
lavishing pains and money on two fragments of the Divine
Office.  Again, one Sunday night, at Wesley's Chapel
in City Road, Antonio heard so sound a sermon on
repentance and restitution that his heart grew warm
with thankfulness until the preacher took a sudden hop,
skip, and jump into a confused doctrine of Justification
which made God less just than man.
</p>

<p>
A week after the King's obsequies Antonio waited
on Mr. Crowberry to remind him that the comptroller
of the Queen's cellars had made no sign.  Mr. Crowberry,
fearful of giving offense, was for indefinite
waiting: but Antonio at last obtained leave to bring the
matter to a head on the ground that he wished to
supervise the bottling before returning to Portugal.  The
comptroller's secretary received the young Portuguese
with courtesy: but, unfortunately, he had nothing
satisfactory to say.
</p>

<p>
One morning, when the hourly thought of his inaction,
at an extra cost to the Castro firm of four pounds
a week, had begun to corrode his self-respect, the
Portuguese called on the comptroller again and pressed him
to name a date.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad you have called," said the great man.
"I could not write what I am about to say.  Will it
derange the firm of Castro if I cancel the order?"
</p>

<p>
Antonio started.
</p>

<p>
"I should add," the comptroller continued, "that in
no case can I accept, or pay for, these wines for a
considerable time.  You have heard, no doubt, that the
administration of the Privy Purse and of the royal
household has not been, in all points, wholly
satisfactory."
</p>

<p>
Antonio turned very pale.  Had he, by his headstrong
importunity, annoyed the firm's most distinguished
customer and done irreparable harm?  It
seemed so.  But a moment later a plan flashed into his
mind.
</p>

<p>
"If I could have a letter," he said, rising, "to say that
owing to His Majesty's death no more wine can be
received at present, and that we are free to sell our
shipment elsewhere, I think Mr. Crowberry will write at
once relieving your Excellency of further anxiety in
the matter."
</p>

<p>
The comptroller purred with pleasure at Antonio's
"Excellency," a word which he had only heard applied
to the persons of ambassadors.  He thanked Antonio
and showed him out graciously.  The next day
Mr. Crowberry was reading such a letter as his assistant
had asked for.
</p>

<p>
Antonio, entering the Jermyn Street office as his
chief was ending the perusal, noted with concern that
there had been another bout of drinking.  Suddenly
Mr. Crowberry, flaming with rage, dashed the letter
down on his desk and exploded like a shell.  His fearful
threats flew out like red-hot nails and the air seemed
sulphurous with his blasphemies.  His nouns and verbs
were few, and the solid matter of his discourse could
hardly be discerned through the lurid vapors of his
cursings.  He swore that, although he had been True
Blue all his life, he would straightway turn Republican.
Concerning the comptroller he was contradictory, first
vowing that he would see him burning in hell before he
would excuse him from receiving a single bottle, and
then declaring that he would pour every drop of the
liquid down the cur's throat.  He added a rude
expression about the young Queen, whereupon Antonio
intervened.
</p>

<p>
"All this is my doing," he said.  "I asked the
comptroller yesterday to write this letter."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Crowberry swung round and faced him in
speechless astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"He told me flatly that he could neither receive nor
pay for our wine for a very long time," Antonio
explained.  "He asked us to release him from the
bargain.  At first I was aghast.  But a plan occurred to
me.  Perhaps I did wrong&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Wrong?" roared Mr. Crowberry.  "Wrong?"  And
he hurled out half a dozen fresh oaths.  "I'll tell
you what it is, Mr. Rocha," he bellowed.  "You're a
damned upstart, and it was a damned bad day for
everybody when that silly old idiot Castro picked you
up out of the gutter."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Austin Crowberry," flashed back Antonio in
tones as sharp as knives, "you will be good enough not
to insult me.  If we begin comparing pedigrees it will
not be to your advantage."
</p>

<p>
"Pssh!" sneered the other, "you remind me of the
damned Irish.  Every drunken Paddy you meet is
descended from a king.  I never met a foreigner yet who
didn't turn out to be a count or a marquis.  Pah!
Shut up.  You make me sick."
</p>

<p>
A tremendous effort enabled Antonio to hold his
tongue and to move towards the door.  But this silent
move only served to drive his employer mad.
</p>

<p>
"So this letter is your doing?" he roared, flinging
himself with his back against the door-handle.
</p>

<p>
"I thought&mdash;" Antonio began.
</p>

<p>
"Thought?  You thought?  Who are you to begin
thinking?  For two pins I'd give you a damned good
hiding."
</p>

<p>
Antonio's face became as white as a sheet.  There
was no longer a monk in the room: only a man.  He
faced his employer with eyes which made him quail.
But he did not lose his head.  Suddenly he wheeled
round and drew from a brass bowl on the table two
of the tiny pins which were used to attach enclosures
to letters.
</p>

<p>
"Here are your two pins, Senhor," he said, flinging
them with infinite scorn at Crowberry's feet.  "Now
give me my damned good hiding."
</p>

<p>
He fell back two paces with his left arm raised in
guard and his right fist clenched to return blow for
blow.  But Mr. Crowberry did not take up the
challenge.  He blenched; blinked; gasped; smirked; edged
away; and finally blurted out peevishly:
</p>

<p>
"Leave the room.  Go out of my office at once."
</p>

<p>
Antonio brushed him aside and stepped into the
street.  His heart was still hot with anger, and he still
smarted under the insults.  With long strides he
hastened mechanically along Piccadilly towards Apsley
House, which had come to be his favorite walk.  But
he had hardly reached the old French Embassy when
there was a turmoil behind him, and voices crying
"Stop!"  He turned round and saw Mr. Crowberry's
office-boy and one of the junior clerks.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Crowb'ry, 'e ses will yer come back at once."
</p>

<p>
"Did Mr. Crowberry say nothing else?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Tell Mr. Crowberry I shall be in Hyde Park, just
inside the arch beyond the palace of the Duke of
Wellington.  I shall not wait longer than twelve o'clock."
</p>

<p>
At five minutes before noon Mr. Crowberry dashed
into the Park upon a bony bay hack, hurriedly hired at
the nearest mews.  The ride had sobered him: and, at
the sight of his honest shamefacedness, Antonio's
wrath and pride broke down into love and pity.  He
helped his chief to alight: and at the mere touch of
hands both men knew that they were reconciled.
</p>

<p>
"It was brandy," said Crowberry very humbly.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad to hear it," Antonio answered.  "If I
thought it was wine I'd never help to make or sell
another drop as long as I live."
</p>

<p>
"Of course I apologize," added the merchant awkwardly.
</p>

<p>
"It's all over and done with," said Antonio.  "Let
us forget it and speak of other matters."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so," agreed Crowberry.  "But there's just
one point.  Don't offer to fight me when I'm sober.
English fists strike hard."
</p>

<p>
"And there's just one point more," retorted Antonio
genially but with conviction.  "Don't offer to
fight me when I'm drunk.  Portuguese fists strike
harder.  Now let me tell you my plan."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Crowberry insisted that the plan should not be
unfolded until they were sitting at meat at his club;
and, on the clear understanding that nothing should be
drunk beyond a bottle of Bordeaux and some soda-water,
Antonio accepted the invitation.
</p>

<p>
Across a thoroughly English leg of lamb, with green
peas, new potatoes and mint sauce, Antonio expounded
his designs.  He started from the fact that Royalty's
house-managers were treating the firm of Castro with
thoroughgoing selfishness.  He went on to say that
when kings and queens, with incomes of half a million
pounds a year, were unscrupulous in guarding their
own convenience, it was high time that Senhor Castro,
who had only been lifted out of imminent bankruptcy
by the strong hand of Mr. Crowberry, should obtain his
just due.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Crowberry agreed, and added a disloyal observation.
</p>

<p>
"But we shall make nothing of the comptroller,"
Antonio continued.  "I find it is your law that the
Queen can do no wrong.  Her Majesty cannot be sued.
Even if she could, it would be madness to try it.  No.
Here is my plan.  We will let the comptroller off with
a mere trifle&mdash;say, a hundred dozen.  Then we will sell
the bulk of the stuff to your nobility and gentry at a
high price, on the strength of our having brought it
over in a specially chartered vessel for the King, whose
untimely decease has deranged the transaction."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Crowberry's face clouded.  He had hoped to
hear a less distasteful proposition.  "I am not a Cheap
Jack," he said a little stiffly.
</p>

<p>
"You misunderstand me," said Antonio, flushing.
"I should hate puffing and touting as much as anybody.
We won't print or even write a single line.  We will
go in person to your best clients and will offer them not
more than fifty dozens each as a great favor.  We will
show them the original order and the comptroller's
letter.  The news will spread; and we shall get back
all our outlay and collect most of our profit six months
earlier than we should get a penny from the Queen."
</p>

<p>
Senhor Castro's partner tilted back his heavy chair
on its hind legs and knitted his brows.  At last he said:
</p>

<p>
"You are right.  We've been badly treated.  We
must look after Number One.  Besides, Castro needs
the money, and I'm not going to lend the firm any
more.  As you say, it can be done with discretion and
dignity.  To-morrow I'll give you a list of likely
people.  You shall start at once."
</p>

<p>
Antonio, however, insisted that Mr. Crowberry
should pilot him to the first half-dozen clients.  Except
Mr. Crowberry's own establishment, where a lax
housekeeper looked very badly after the widower and
his son, the monk had never entered a private house in
England, and he called it unreasonable to send him on
so delicate an errand alone.
</p>

<p>
With a wry face Mr. Crowberry gave in.  The same
afternoon the comptroller accepted his hundred dozens,
and kindly wrote a further letter giving the house of
Castro leave to do as they pleased with the remainder
of their own property.  And by the evening of the
following day the odd pair of commercial travelers
had sold nearly a thousand pounds' worth of wine.  In
five houses out of six their visit was received with
gushing gratitude.  To possess the Castro port seemed
to fire the knights' and baronets' imaginations; not
because it was the magnificent remnant of an unparalleled
vintage, but because it had narrowly escaped being
drunk by a king.
</p>

<p>
So delighted was the volatile Crowberry with his
experiences that he swung right round and announced
that he would accompany Antonio on a fortnight's tour
through the Home and Midland counties.  He hired a
roomy and well-hung post-chaise, loaded it with ten
dozen bottles as samples, and was out of London within
thirty hours of broaching the scheme.
</p>

<p>
After the smells and smoke and uproar of London
the fair English country was like paradise to Antonio.
He knew the beautiful Minho of Portugal: but this
England was more beautiful still.  Once, as they rolled
through a village in Bucks, the gracious loveliness of
the scene almost broke his heart.  The mellow beams of
the setting sun were softly caressing the square tower
of the church and glorifying the solemn old yews which
girt it round.  Over all, the motionless, gilded weathercock
burned like a flame in a high wind.  Children were
shouting and playing outside white cottages half hidden
under red roses.  Up to their knees in murmuring
water beside a steep gray bridge, dreamy-eyed cattle
swished their tails and chewed their cud.  The bright
green meadows were enameled with myriads of white
and pink and blue and yellow flowers, and the wanton
hedgerows wore long streamers of convolvulus and
honeysuckle.  High in the giant elms rooks cawed
steadily with a raucous but homely sound.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," chaffed Mr. Crowberry, "you'll see
her again soon."
</p>

<p>
"Her?" echoed Antonio, starting.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Her.  Teresa or Dolores or Maria or Luiza
or Carmen.  Don't be down in the dumps.  You'll see
her again before long."
</p>

<p>
"I think not," said Antonio.  But he winced as he
realized how nearly the wine-merchant had interpreted
his mood.  The children's cries, the curling smoke of
the homesteads, all the sweet sights and sounds of the
village, had awakened in him a vague sense of his
lovelessness and loneliness.  He was glad when, half an
hour later, they reached their inn: and before he
surrendered himself to imperious sleep he knelt for a long,
long time beside the great mahogany bed and prayed
as he had not prayed for many a day.
</p>

<p><a id="chap0205"></a></p>

<h3>
V
</h3>

<p>
Altogether, Mr. Crowberry and Antonio sold six
thousand pounds' worth of wine.  In only three out of
the seven-and-forty houses they visited was their
reception suspicious or cool.  Indeed, their errand was
so acceptable that they rarely slept or dined at an inn.
</p>

<p>
Antonio had heard much of English wealth and
luxury: but the solid comfort and daily lavishness
amazed him.  Often on the well-kept roads he would
encounter a dashing equipage drawn by high-stepping
slender grays and followed by a pack of spotted
Dalmatian dogs.  Sometimes he got more than a glimpse
of rigid, expressionless footmen, powdered and
gorgeously appareled, and of bright-eyed, rosy-cheeked
ladies in high-waisted dresses and with plumes nodding
over their pretty heads.  Nor did his post-chaise ever
bowl many miles without passing some ivied castle or
stately home.
</p>

<p>
At the squires' and lords' tables Antonio was a
success.  He rarely spoke until he was addressed: but
such remarks as he made were all sensible and interesting,
and his foreign accent made them piquant to hear.
At every meal the talk turned sooner or later to the
townsmen's agitation for abolishing the Corn Laws
and for fostering industrialism at all costs until
England became the workshop of the world.  In his rôle
of the Intelligent Foreigner Antonio was generally
asked his opinion.  He would reply that no nation
could be enduringly healthy and wealthy unless the
majority of her children nourished themselves directly
from Mother Earth; and although this way of putting
it rather bewildered his hosts, Antonio's practical
conclusion in favor of agriculture was always applauded.
</p>

<p>
Too often for the monk's ease the table-talk turned
to religion.  The English notables took it for granted
that, as an Intelligent Foreigner, Antonio must be a
French skeptic.  They hated atheism less than Popery;
and although most of them were church-going men,
they would have preferred that Antonio should believe
nothing at all to his believing in the Christian religion
plus the Pope.  On such occasions Antonio always
strained his wits to turn the subject: but whenever
his host or a fellow-guest had the bad taste to be
persistent he would reply with spirit that Rome was
no more intolerant to Protestantism than Canterbury
was to Dissent; that perfunctory and greedy priests
were no more common than perfunctory and greedy
parsons; and that the essential truths of revealed
religion were far more widely and firmly believed in
Portugal than in England.  Once or twice a
fellow-diner, who had heard of the suppression of the
monasteries, would launch a jest or a sneer against monks:
whereupon Antonio would boldly answer:
</p>

<p>
"They were good men.  I made wine for years in
an abbey vineyard, and I ought to know."
</p>

<p>
Once, strangely enough, Antonio and Mr. Crowberry
ate a lugubrious luncheon in the house of a poor
and proud Catholic family who had kept the faith,
with occasional lapses, through the three centuries of
persecution.  But intermarriage and isolation had
done them no good.  When Mr. Crowberry introduced
his lieutenant as a fellow-believer they responded
uneasily.  They seemed to be without a trace
of the missionary spirit, and to look with alarm upon
the incipient revival of Catholicism lest the mob should
shout out for new penal laws.  An extremely aged
French priest, a refugee from the Terror, was their
chaplain; and all they wished was to be left alone in
a tiny Popish enclave among the surrounding
Protestantism.
</p>

<p>
In the long run, however, Antonio could not judge
them harshly.  Five or six of the great houses he
visited were called This or That Abbey, or The Other
Priory, and their spacious halls had been the
refectories or chapter-houses of religious orders.  Often a
mouldering arch or a traceried window of the monks'
church had been conserved for its picturesqueness; and
as Antonio lingered among these holy relics he could
understand the negation of the Papacy and the
denunciation of monasticism on which the Tudor aristocrats
founded their fortunes and builded their houses.
Early one morning as he stood beside a broken pillar
which alone survived to mark the site of one of the
most renowned monasteries in Britain, his heart sank
at the thought of his own white chapel, fronting the
Atlantic storms all neglected and forsaken.  If, after
three hundred years, no one had restored these waste
places of Zion in England, how could he hope,
single-handed, to do better in Portugal?  But he remembered
with joy the essential difference.  Portugal had torn
a limb from the Church: but she had not lost the
Faith.
</p>

<p>
Amidst this whirl of distractions Antonio was
secretly living his religious life with unwonted fervor.
Not only did he recite the Office with close attention
but he lost no opportunity of fighting on the angels'
side.  As the acknowledged expert of the company he
told the truth emphatically about spirits, and even
preached up French clarets as against the Englishman's
favorite liquored port.  At first these opinions
disconcerted Mr. Crowberry: but, at the second hearing,
he took Antonio on one side and astonished him
by saying that it was the cleverest move he had ever
seen in his life.  Antonio, however, could endure this
cynical misjudgment: for he had the satisfaction of
knowing that he had frightened at least one brandy-sot
out of his ugly and suicidal habit.
</p>

<p>
It was at the dinner-table of an earl that the monk
perceived most sharply the contrast between his inward
and his outward life.  While he was donning in his
room the fine clothes with which Mr. Crowberry had
equipped him for the journey, he had been suddenly
filled with such a sense of God's love and presence as
he had never known before.  Throughout the lively
dinner, although he took his due part in conversation,
this ecstasy endured.  He seemed to be two persons
in one body.  Across the table he could see himself
reflected in the beveled mirror of a vast mahogany
sideboard.  At closer quarters the mirror reflected the
butler solemnly pouring champagne into tall French
flutes of purest silver.  In the back of the picture,
brilliantly lit by many candles, Antonio could see his
own reflection.  He thought of the Antonio in flapping
clothes who had lived for weeks in Oporto on salt fish
and dark bread so that he might repay the cura's loan,
and he compared him with the new Antonio, in broadcloth
and fine linen.  On his left sat the earl's niece, a
magnificent young dame with a rope of pearls round
her neck and a diamond tiara in her hair.  According
to a custom of Puritan England, which has always
bewildered visitors from less prudish countries, she
was dining in a kind of ball-dress which revealed arms
and shoulders as white and shapely as a statue's.  All
the themes of the talk were of the world, worldly:
but Antonio's whole heart remained in heaven.
</p>

<p>
Not that he was always indifferent to the charms
and graces of beautiful women.  On the contrary, he
was generally at his best in their presence.  And
women, in their turn, were enchanted with Antonio,
Indeed, one self-willed beauty concealed so little of
her admiration for the handsome and courtly Southerner
that during a tour of the greenhouses she plucked
a flower which he had admired and placed it in his
hand.  Her look, as she did so, had meanings: but
Antonio was not a gawk, and he received the keepsake
with such easy tact that the affair would have
ended had not the inquisitive Crowberry caught the
lady's eye.  From that day forward he hardly ceased
rallying Antonio on his conquest.  Having heard that,
in Portugal, a commoner shares the title of the
Duchess he marries, Mr. Crowberry began to call
Antonio "Your Grace" and to paint lurid pictures of
the frightful revenge shortly to be wreaked by
Antonio's jilted Teresa.
</p>

<p>
On returning to London and to the Jermyn Street
office Mr. Crowberry found that the news of his offer
had spread, and that orders had arrived by post which
would exhaust the whole shipment of wine.  A little
figuring showed that Antonio's plan had earned for
the firm of Castro eleven hundred pounds more than
the sum which would have been tardily paid by the
royal household.  Mr. Crowberry was radiant.  He
pressed upon Antonio a hundred guineas, and added
that if Senhor Castro did not give him a hundred
guineas more he was an even worse miser than he
looked.  Mr. Crowberry concluded by saying that
Antonio was too good for a piggery like Oporto, and
that he must stay and make his fortune in London.
</p>

<p>
Antonio shook his head.  How did he know that he
was not already too late, and that the abbey had not
passed irrevocably into desecrating hands?  Now that
he had amassed his two hundred pounds his course
was clear.  Besides, he was home-sick.  For days he
had been thinking of his famous namesake, the holy
Antonio, called of Padua, but properly of Lisbon,
whose crowning self-mortification was to exile
himself for life from beautiful Portugal.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, he gave way to the next request of his
kindly chief.  Young Edward Crowberry, a muffish
youth with soft yellow hair, was to be placed for three
years in the Oporto office; and, with a view to shaking
him up and opening his mind, Mr. Crowberry begged
Antonio to take him overland through France and
Spain.  He himself, he said, would go by sea and
meet them at Oporto.
</p>

<p>
Landing at Boulogne one August afternoon, Antonio
and his charge traveled by a fast public coach to
Amiens, and there, for the first time, the monk found
his dreams of a Gothic cathedral come true.  From
Amiens they went to Beauvais, whose overweening
choir offended his religious sense.  At Rouen he
lingered in wonder.  The cathedral, with its unstudied
harmony of many styles, reminded him of the Church
herself&mdash;a divine idea working itself out in history
through many minds, yet never in self-contradiction.
Notre Dame de Paris also impressed him deeply: it
seemed bigger than Paris, bigger than France, and
to be challenging both the metropolis and the nation
to a truer grandeur of spirit and conduct.  In the
dimness cast by the thirteenth-century glass of
Chartres he thought of Westminster Abbey, with its
huddle of pagan monuments, and compared it with our
Lady's glorious shrine, wherein not a single body, not
even a saint's, lay buried.  The stone embroideries of
the west front of Tours recalled to him Henry the
Fourth's saying that it ought to be under a glass case:
and Antonio liked it the less on that account.
</p>

<p>
A torrential burst of rain had so replenished the
meager Loire that the travelers reached the city of
Saint Martin in a light boat, from which they saw
some of the châteaux of Touraine.  But at the riverside
inns Antonio was as deeply engrossed in the common
wines as in the neighboring architecture.  As he
drank them, white and red, he understood the wit and
elegance of the Tourangeans, and wondered what the
English would become if they could daily drink such
draughts in place of their nerve-destroying tea, their
brandied port, and their sluggish beer.  But, although
Mr. Crowberry senior had enjoined Antonio to show
Mr. Crowberry junior as many cellars and vineyards
as possible, the monk recognized the hopelessness of
sending the brisk juices of the Loire to the stolid
drinkers of the Thames; and therefore he pushed on
through Poitiers and Angoulême to Bordeaux.
</p>

<p>
At Bordeaux the two inquirers hired an imposing
chariot.  They were armed with letters of
introduction to the great growers; and decency required that
they should keep up appearances during their
triumphal progress through the Medoc.  The vintage
was in full swing: but it lacked the gaiety of the
vintage in Portugal.  Most of the vintagers were
strangers from Poitiers, who did their work, drew
their pay, and went home to spend it.  The little
bush-vines also, though marvelously well tended, lacked the
picturesqueness of Portugal: and Antonio almost
excited his yellow-haired charge by describing the great
bunches of purple grapes pending from the green roof
of a pergola, or blooming like clustered plums high in
some tree with which the vine was intertwined.
</p>

<p>
The two were fêted at Brane Cantenac; patronized
a little at the Château Margaux; treated respectfully
at the Châteaux Lafitte, Leoville, and Larose; and
received with open arms at the Château Latour.
Young Crowberry expanded rapidly under the attentions
which were lavished on him as the son of a big
buyer: and it was only by hurrying him out of Pauillac
in the nick of time that his mentor forestalled a
desperate love-affair with a Basque maiden, dark and
slender.  As for Antonio, as an expert from Oporto,
he was treated with deference, and he made the most
of his opportunities.  He would taste attentively the
ripe grapes and then compare them with the wines of
the same vineyard, both young and old.
</p>

<p>
From Royan, at the mouth of the Gironde, they
ran before the wind in a smack as far as San Sebastian,
in Spain, and posted thence, past bald limestone
mountains, to Burgos.  Young Crowberry, in whom Wine
and his glimpse of Woman had wrought wonders,
found the cathedral of Burgos worth all the cathedrals
of France put together: and Antonio himself, while
conscious of its faults, felt strangely moved by its
beauties.  Three days later they were in Valladolid,
where young Crowberry, making rapid progress,
declared that with a box of building-bricks he himself
would design a better cathedral than Herrera's fragment.
At Salamanca, the last stopping-place in Spain,
nearly all that Antonio had read about architecture
was contradicted.  Here was a cathedral raised in
almost the worst period of Gothic: yet it impressed the
beholder as one of the grandest temples in the world.
</p>

<p>
They left Salamanca early one October morning,
while the city's grand towers and domes were still
sharply silhouetted against the golden east.  Young
Crowberry was garrulous and dogmatic about everything;
but Antonio hardly spoke, for he was nearing
Portugal.  Mile after mile of dreary plain resounded
under the mules' little hoofs.  At last the road began
to climb awful mountains whence the malaria had
driven nearly every living thing.  They passed
stone-huts of prehistoric hill-men, and Roman military
monuments with braggart inscriptions.  Then they
descended.  The landscape relaxed its frown.  A few
vines greened narrow terraces here and there in the
rocks.  Soon afterwards they reached a white house in
the midst of orange trees.  Two soldiers came out
with muskets.
</p>

<p>
Antonio was once more in Portugal.

<h3>
VI
</h3>

<p>
On the morrow of young Crowberry's reunion with
his impatient father at Oporto, Antonio made haste
to give an account of his stewardship.  About ten
pounds in gold remained in his purse and he held, still
uncashed, a letter of credit for thirty pounds more.
Mr. Crowberry burst out laughing.
</p>

<p>
"If Teddy hadn't told me ten times over that he's
fared like a fighting-cock," he said, "I should believe
you've been living on fresh air and ship's biscuit."
</p>

<p>
"I did my best to make him enjoy his travels,"
responded Antonio, "but, at the same time, I was
reasonably careful."
</p>

<p>
"You've made a man of him, anyway," said the
proud parent.  "He used to be the biggest muff in
England.  Believe me or not: but I've never had to
knock him down until this morning."
</p>

<p>
"This morning you knocked him down?" echoed
Antonio, aghast.  As a Portuguese he had been
accustomed to see parents obey their children.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God, yes," said Mr. Crowberry heartily.
"He was too damnably impudent about claret.  But
pick up this money.  I don't want it, and I won't have
it."
</p>

<p>
The Englishman's determination was unshakable,
so Antonio picked up the coins and the draft.  But he
did so with reluctance: for it made doubly hard his
task of announcing that he sought release from the
firm of Castro.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Crowberry was first incredulous, then contemptuous,
and finally furious.  He tried every device,
from ridicule to blasphemy, in order to dissuade
Antonio from his purpose.  But the monk respectfully
and gratefully stood firm.  His heart, he said, was in
the South.  He hoped to buy a derelict farm which
adjoined the vineyards of the suppressed abbey where
he had made wine before coming to Oporto.  More:
he had even thought of approaching the Government
for a lease of the monks' vineyards, with an option
of outright purchase at the end of ten years.  His
intention, he added, was to make a Portuguese claret
of supreme quality, such as should please an unprejudiced
English palate more than the wines of Bordeaux,
the growths of the grandest châteaux hardly
excepted.  He ended by very modestly begging
Mr. Crowberry to act as his London agent on liberal terms.
</p>

<p>
Senhor Castro, on whom Mr. Crowberry ultimately
devolved the task of shaking their assistant's
resolution, was less unwilling to see Antonio go.  He was
a timid man: and although the operation with the
Waterloo port had brought him an unexpected five
hundred pounds at a very awkward moment of pressure
in his private finance, he was fearful lest the next
bold campaign should lead all concerned into disaster.
Accordingly he presented his faithful servant with
twenty pounds, to go with Mr. Crowberry's hundred
guineas, and assured him of his friendly interest in all
that Antonio might attempt in the South.
</p>

<p>
Mounted upon a stout little white horse which he
knew he could sell at a profit after finishing his
journey, Antonio set his face southward one misty
October morning.  In his belt he carried two hundred and
seventy-three pounds of English bank-notes and gold,
as well as a few thousand reis in Portuguese silver
for his expenses on the road.  But although this
beltful was so much larger than he had dared to hope for,
he returned at once to the severe frugality of the days
before he set sail for England.  He hardly ever lay
or ate in an inn.  Tethering the docile little horse to
a tree, he would take his night's rest in some
out-of-the-way thicket.  His meals were once more of black
bread, snowy cheese, and ruby wine.  These he would
vary by occasional purchases of fruit.  The last of the
fresh figs and the first of the dried were in the markets,
and the monk's halfpenny bought two heaped handsful
of either.
</p>

<p>
With forebodings of change in his heart, Antonio
made the short detour which would bring him to the
parish of the old cura.  His fear was not belied.  The
spruceness of the gardens and the crystal clearness of
the presbytery windows were infallible signs that a
new reign had begun.
</p>

<p>
"When did the old padre die?" asked Antonio of a
fisherman who was lounging against the church wall.
</p>

<p>
"Last year, Senhor."
</p>

<p>
"Had he a long illness?"
</p>

<p>
"Not long.  My son was with him when he died.
The reverend Bishop was there too.  On his last day
our padre told them all that he was glad to be done with
his pains and troubles; but he said he would cheerfully
bear them longer, if it was God's will, so that he might
change his life and begin to do a little good."
</p>

<p>
"But surely he had done good already!" exclaimed
Antonio.
</p>

<p>
"Senhor," said the fisherman, almost resentfully,
"we didn't know it till he was gone, because his ways
were rough: but he was a saint walking the earth.
Good?  Had he done good?  I dare say he had done
more good than your Worship."
</p>

<p>
As Antonio continued his ride south he fell to thinking.
In England he had once sat at dinner next to a
whiskered curate, who was hot with anger against a
proposal by one of the new-fangled High Churchmen
to call a chapel-of-ease Saint Alban's.  As far as
Antonio could ascertain the Church of England recognized
no saints after the apostolic age, and certainly
none after the fourth century.  Yet Antonio himself
could name at least three Christians who had died
saints' deaths, and at least one who had lived a saint's
life.
</p>

<p>
Strangely enough it was on the same day, only a
few hours after his pious reverie about sainthood, that
Antonio succumbed for a season to the wiles of the
devil.  At midday the autumn sun was strong and he
entered a roadside shanty for a pull of wine.  Two or
three peasants who were drinking made way for him
respectfully; and Antonio's patriotic pride was stirred
by the contrast between their quiet dignity and the
vulgar shouting so common in the estaminets of
France.  The wine was bright and sharp, the floor
was clean, and the little wooden hut was pleasantly
dim and cool.  But suddenly Antonio caught sight of
himself in a cheap mirror, in a tawdry gilt frame,
which hung behind the counter.  The glass was so
bad that it distorted the handsomest faces into
lopsided masks.
</p>

<p>
In an instant Antonio was transported back to
England and to the great dining-room of the earl with
its lordly sideboard and beveled mirror.  He did not
remember his unworldly ecstasy of that night: he saw
only the beeswax candles, the snowy linen, the bubble-thin
glasses, the crimson roses, the creaming wine, the
scarlet footmen, and the white-armed young beauty
in her proud diamonds and soft pearls.  That&mdash;all
that&mdash;was the flattering, delicious life on which he
had turned his back in order that he might live and
die in a wilderness, toiling early and late on stock-fish
and chick-peas and dark bread and peasant's wine.
</p>

<p>
Tired out as he was by hard days and nights this
sudden temptation overthrew Antonio.  The cabin
which had lured him aside from the garish dusty road
by its dimness and coolness suddenly seemed foul and
mean, the soft-eyed, soft-voiced countrymen seemed
louts, the refreshing wine seemed sugar and vinegar.
Forgetting everybody's presence he broke into a loud,
bitter laugh, flung down the price of ten glasses of
wine, scrambled upon his horse and dashed away.
</p>

<p>
"That man is mad," said one of the peasants, gazing
after the bobbing black core of the dwindling cloud of
dust.
</p>

<p>
"He has committed a crime," said another more gravely.
</p>

<p>
"He is a Spaniard," said a third: and all felt that
he had uttered the crowning word of horror.
</p>

<p>
For the first time in his life Antonio was cruel to a
dumb beast.  He struck at his horse's flanks savagely,
lashing him on through dust and heat.  His whole
soul was storming with rebellion.  But a whinnying
sound of pain and fear recalled him to his better self.
He reined in his horse.  The poor brute, accustomed
to a gentle Portuguese master and filled with fright
and bewilderment at these strange doings, whinnied
again.
</p>

<p>
Leaping down, Antonio patted the quivering neck
and looked round in the hope that there might be
water.  The scene which met his eyes shamed him.
He was within a stone's-throw of the pine-clad hill
where he had passed his first night out of doors, just
after he fled from his brethren at Navares.  With a
rush of penitence he obeyed the sign.  He thought of
that good horse Babieca, the battle-charger of the
Cid&mdash;that good horse who knelt down of his own accord
outside the hidden shrine at the capture of Toledo.
Still stroking and patting his animal's neck, Antonio
led the way up into the grove.  There he found the
curved bark of a cork tree, and, turning up the two
ends, he poured into this rude horse-trough every drop
of wine from the skins in his saddle-bags and held it to
the parched muzzle as a peace-offering.
</p>

<p>
The little white horse, having an excellent judgment,
speedily licked the cork dry: but Antonio made no
haste to remount.  Unless some ill befell, he would
know before nightfall whether he had come on a
fool's errand or not.  This was the last day of his
journey: and it was fitting that he should recover a
clear mind and a quiet spirit.
</p>

<p>
What sights were in store for him?  Would he find
the brook-side farm as trim as the old cura's presbytery,
with a new master tending the orangery and the
vineyard?  And what of the monastery?  Perhaps
children were playing in and out of the cells, while
beasts chewed maize-leaves in the cloisters.  For more
than two years Antonio had lacked news of the
abbey's fate.  Indeed, only twice since his northward
flight had he heard a word about it.  The man from
Lisbon, to whom he owed his start in the house of
Castro, had told Antonio that the Lisbon authorities
were not forcing the sale of this particular property
because they did not wish to revive the scandal of
Ponte Quebrada and the stolen treasures.  But this
was two summers ago: and much might have
happened since then.
</p>

<p>
Recumbent under the pines Antonio began to
revolve plans of action in case either the farm or the
abbey should have passed into other hands.  But he
soon desisted from his thinking.  After all, had not
the same problem pressed upon him many a time in
Oporto, and had he not always solved it in the same
way?  To keep the holy place inviolate until the
monk's toil and self-denial should enable him to
return&mdash;this surely was God's part of the work.  Antonio
rose to his feet, confident that he was not too late.
</p>

<p>
The clock was striking five when he cantered
through Navares.  As he passed the tavern where he
had been insulted, and the white barns of the
corn-merchant, he seemed to be revisiting hardly
recognizable scenes; for the failing light of the November
afternoon was not like the June evening of the monks'
exodus.  Most of the vines beside the roads had been
stripped of their leaves, and such foliage as remained
was discolored and tattered.  And there was something
melancholy in the autumn fields, where giant
gourds of many colors lay on the bare earth among
the drooping maize-plants.  He pressed on.  Very
soon he reached the spot where the Prior had met the
courier from Lisbon: but he was hardly sure of it in
the gloom.  The darkness deepened, and his little
white horse trotted through it, glimmering like a ghost.
At last the pleasant voice of hurrying waters hailed
him through the dusk.
</p>

<p>
He had reached the farm.
</p>

<p>
No light, no sound, met Antonio's straining eyes
and ears as he climbed the knoll.  Leaving his horse
to graze, he advanced eagerly into the midst of the
silent buildings.  They were still deserted.  He pushed
through rank growths into the orangery, and as he
touched one of the pale orbs above his head he knew
that the farm had lain all the time uncared-for and
untilled.  With a full heart he gave thanks to God.
</p>

<p>
The dull booming of the sulky Atlantic was almost
drowned by the cheerful clatter of the headlong brook.
Antonio drew near to the vociferous waters as if to
compel an answer to his question.  Hardly an hour
before those waters had leaped down the mountain
above the guest-house, they had danced through the
monks' vineyard, they had plunged along the dark
tunnel which led them under the refectory, they had
resounded strangely in the vast kitchen, they had
emerged into the Abbot's garden, and at last they had
tumbled headlong down the slopes to seethe and shout
at Antonio's feet.  He would fain have demanded of
them, "Is all well?"
</p>

<p>
But it was needful to possess his soul in patience
until the rising of the moon: so Antonio returned to
his saddle-bags and drew forth a supper of bread and
dried figs.  From time to time he would mount the
knoll and would peer vainly through the darkness in
the direction of the monastery.  Once or twice, to kill
time, he wandered back along the road: but he soon
returned, for the moaning of the Atlantic made itself
drearily insistent whenever he got out of hearing of the
merry torrent.
</p>

<p>
As the hour of moonrise drew nearer the monk's
heart beat faster.  Deep down in his soul there was
still a calm confidence that all was well: but the surface
of his mind was tumultuous with myriad hopes and
fears.  He tried to groom his horse and left the work
half done: he began to say his rosary and broke off
half-way through the second Mystery: he sat down,
rose up, and sat down again twenty times.  Perhaps
the monastery had escaped desecration: but who could
assure him that winter gales and summer heats and
spring floods had not torn off roofs or shrunk up
timbers or whirled away walls?  For all he knew the
moon would rise upon a ruin.
</p>

<p>
At length a smear of watery light along the horizon
showed that the moon's orb was urging up into a bank
of mist.  Antonio turned and ran to the top of the
knoll in time to see a vague luminosity blanching the
leaden waters of the ocean.  Near objects became
visible.  He could make out the white oblong of the
farmstead and the white flanks of his horse.  But the
further landscape and the tops of the hills seemed
withdrawn into denser shadow than before.
</p>

<p>
The suspense was hard to bear: but Antonio knew
it could not be prolonged.  Above the bank of cloud
stars were shining in a clear heaven.  He waited.
Now and again he uttered fragments of prayers.
</p>

<p>
The cloud-bank went on sinking slowly into the sea
all the time the moon was mounting out of it, until the
rim of the round shield gleamed like a piece of old
silver-gilt through the last smoky veil.  Then the rim
of the shield pushed up clear, shining against the blue
as cold and sharp and bright as a scythe.  Antonio
yearned towards it, trembling all over: but he did not
turn round till the entire white orb was floating free
before his eyes.
</p>

<p>
He gazed down the knoll and saw, as clear as noon-day,
the old camp of the monks and the troopers.  He
saw the extent of the farm, its house and buildings, its
fields and vineyards and orchards.  He saw the
Atlantic, firm and shining, like a field of ice.  He saw
his horse, tethered to a tree and grazing softly.  He
saw the swirling brook, like liquid jet, bearing curds
and suds and bergs of snow.  He saw the straight
pines, the jeweled orange-grove, the white road, the
violet heavens.  Then, with the Name upon his lips,
he turned round.
</p>

<p>
High on her holy hill, with a rich curtain of
pine-woods drawn out behind her throne, the abbey chapel
looked down upon Antonio all white and fair and
inviolate.  The rains which had burst around her and
the suns which had burned upon her had only
enhanced her whiteness, till she shone like her Lord,
transfigured upon Mount Hermon.  A cry burst from
Antonio's lips.  His heart sang <i>Tola pulchra es amica
mea</i>: "Thou art altogether fair, my love."  The
chapel seemed a glorious ark, newly borne to rest upon
her Ararat by the floods of silver moonlight.  Like
Saint John on Patmos Antonio could have cried: "I
see the holy city, the new Jerusalem, descending from
heaven, from God, arrayed like a Bride adorned for
her Bridegroom."  In Antonio's ears, as in John's, an
angel seemed to say: "Come, and I will show thee the
Bride, the spouse of the Lamb."
</p>

<p>
Antonio had planned to wait until daybreak before
he sought entrance to his old home.  But the Spirit of
God bade him re-enter the sacred place in the first
ecstasy of his vision.  "<i>Spiritus et sponsa dicunt, Veni</i>:
The Spirit and the Bride say, Come,'" Antonio
murmured; and he began to climb the hill.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0207"></a></p>

<h3>
VII
</h3>

<p>
Antonio knew a spot where the brook, swollen with
winter rains, had smashed down the arch through
which it used to flow: and there he scrambled up into
the abbey domain.  The ever-mounting moon
illuminated the familiar scenes with fairy radiance.
</p>

<p>
<i>Emitte lucem tuam</i>, said Antonio in fervent prayer
and thanksgiving, as he breasted the weed-grown slope.
"Send forth thy light and thy truth: they shall lead
me to thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles, and I will
go unto the altar of God."  And when an opening in
the trees once more showed him the glistening chapel
his mind swung from the Psalter to the Apocalypse,
and he thought once more of Saint John's vision of the
Bride <i>habentem claritatem Dei</i>: "having the clear-shining
of God, and her light like a precious stone's,
like a jasper's, like crystal."
</p>

<p>
Grass was growing between the paving-stones in
front of the chapel and lichens flourished on the north
wall.  The gardens were unkempt, and one had to
break a way through alleys and avenues.  On banks
and terraces the fleshy-leaved ice-plant had secured firm
holding.  But, so far as outward appearances went,
the abbey had suffered no irreparable harm.
</p>

<p>
Massive padlocks guarded all the entrances, while
seals, affixed to stout bands of linen, spoke eloquently
of the zeal which the Government had shown after the
affair of their precious Visconde de Ponte Quebrada.
But Antonio was not to be dismayed by locks, bolts,
and bars.  For years he had cherished a plan of obtaining
entrance to the monastery, and he did not delay its
execution.
</p>

<p>
Antonio knew that, hidden in the wood, there was
a sluice by which the torrent's waters could be diverted
from the abbey kitchen into their original channel.
This sluice had been used only four times a year, when
the bed of the stream was cleaned out: but it was kept
in good working order.  As he plunged under the trees
the monk understood the difference between the brightest
moonlight and the weakest daylight: but he had
little difficulty in finding what he sought.
</p>

<p>
The gear of the sluice was stiff: but Antonio was
strong, and his task was soon accomplished.  For the
first time in three years the water began gurgling
among the dust and dead leaves of its ancient bed, and
nothing but a slender runnel was left for the stone
channel which ran through the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
Antonio threw off his boots and socks and outer
garments and swung himself down into the ankle-deep
stream.  Before him yawned the black tunnel by which
the waters passed over the whole width of the refectory,
a distance of about eight yards.  He went down
on his hands and knees and crawled along towards the
ghostly light which gleamed at the further end.  His
progress was painful.  The small boulders which had
accumulated in the passage during three years of
neglect cut his hands and bruised his knees and tore his
feet.  But he did not turn back; and soon he was
standing in the moon-lit kitchen.
</p>

<p>
The blue-and-white tiles, the blue Pas on its white
ground, the stoves, the great jars and pots, the
burnished copper chimney&mdash;all were there as of old.
Antonio opened the door of the refectory.  Six or
seven of the bottles emptied by the Visconde and the
captain had been stacked in a corner, probably by
some person who went through the monastery before
the padlocking and sealing: but in all other respects
the noble room was in perfect order.
</p>

<p>
The monk made his way to the cells.  They had not
been disturbed since the monks quitted them.  The big
candelabrum had not been removed from the cell of
the Abbot.  Antonio entered his own cell with a
thumping pulse.  The few books and oddments which,
despite the strict letter of Saint Benedict's rule, had been
considered his own, were all in their due places.  A
spare habit was hanging on the wall.  Portugal's
wonderful climate had kept it so dry and sweet that he put
it on as if it were the coat he had left lying on the grass
outside.
</p>

<p>
The garb had not grown strange to Antonio: for
since his expulsion from the abbey rarely had a day
passed without his saying some part of the Divine
Office, garbed in the rusty habit which he had worn at
Navares.  But, as he donned the Benedictine uniform
in his own cell of a Benedictine abbey, the monk's
emotion overpowered him.  The cell was too straight and
dark for the immense and sublime expansion of his
spirit.  He hastened out, along the dim corridor, and
up the winding steps which led to the flat roof of the
cloister.
</p>

<p>
Antonio sat down on the cork bench where he had
mused on the night of his ordination, just before he
heard the chink of steel.  The November moonlight
was not less gracious than the May dusk.  The cross in
the monks' graveyard uprose as white and slender as
a taper on an altar, and all the earth seemed consecrated
ground.  And there the young priest sat for a
long time, without moving, while he recalled, beginning
with the march to Navares, the motley events
which had filled the one-and-forty months of his exile.
Finally he lived over again his last night in the abbey.
Other men, other scenes, other words, other deeds
seemed faint and far away: but the face of the dying
Abbot was clear in his memory, and the old man's
words might still have been sounding in the young
monk's ears.  Above all else the Abbot's prophecy
rang out like bells: "I see our chapel, swept and
garnished.  I see Antonio, in his old place, doing the
work of God."
</p>

<p>
The hour was come.  He rose and descended the
spiral stairway.  At the entrance of the chapel he
paused, and, falling upon his knees, implored pardon
for his brief apostasy in the roadside wine-shop.  Then
with bowed head and reverent steps he crossed the
sacred threshold.
</p>

<p>
The few windows were placed so high and were so
deeply set in the thick walls that very little moonlight
could enter the chapel.  Nearly all the nave was filled
with darkness.  But the choir, raised on a marble floor,
could be dimly seen, while the altar, higher still,
received the full glory of the light.  The doors of the
empty tabernacle were wide open, as on Good Friday,
the six tall candles still stood in their places, and no one
had removed the vases with their silver-gilt symbols of
the Holy Eucharist&mdash;wheat-ears and vine-leaves and
grapes.  Behind the crucifix rose a statue of our Lady
treading down a serpent and holding forth towards
Antonio the divine Child.  Upon his head was a crown
set with brilliants of old paste which burned bluish
white in the cold moonlight.
</p>

<p>
Antonio groped his way to his old stall.  There,
humbly kneeling upon his knees, he offered up his
prayers and praise.  He prayed for his brethren of
three years before, picturing each one of them in his
particular stall; and his most fervent petitions were for
the good estate of Father Sebastian, alive or dead.
</p>

<p>
It was the time of Matins.  He thought of his monastic
brethren throughout the world rising from their
beds to praise God, some of them under the soaring
vaults of proud and rich abbeys, some of them in the
poor lodgings of weary exiles.  His prodigious memory
enabled him, without the aid of a book, to recite nearly
the whole of Matins, including parts of the Proper; and
this he did, rising up and kneeling down as if the whole
community were reciting the Office with him.
</p>

<p>
As he rose from his knees the moon's light had all
but faded from the chapel.  Only upon the bright
points of the Holy Child's diadem did some stray beam
mysteriously linger.  And Antonio, abiding in his
place, his soul filled full with peace, said softly: "<i>Civitas
non eget sole</i>: 'The city hath no need of the sun, nor
of the moon to beam in her; for God's clear-shining
hath enlightened her and her lamp is the Lamb.'"
</p>

<p>
Thus did Antonio, in his old place, begin once more
to do the Work of God.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0208"></a></p>

<h3>
VIII
</h3>

<p>
The village nearest to the abandoned farm nestled on
the other side of the hill, about four miles away.
Thither Antonio tramped at sunrise.  Had he ridden
his horse the natives might have formed swollen notions
as to his wealth and manner of life: so he footed
it modestly, in his oldest clothes.
</p>

<p>
The tiny, parchment-faced old dame at whose wine-shop
he ate and drank a threepenny breakfast was able
and willing to tell him nearly all he wanted to know.
The farm, she said, belonged to a bed-ridden widow in
Navares, whose husband and two sons had been killed
by the same Constitutionalist volley during the first
Miguelista attack on Oporto.  This poor widow, she
added, was living unhappily with her only daughter,
the wife of a Navares tanner.
</p>

<p>
It was safe for Antonio to show himself openly in
the village and to ask his questions: for the monks had
kept inclosure with such strictness that the villagers
could have no recollection of the younger fathers.  But
he deemed it prudent to hold his tongue about the
deserted monastery; and, having put down his three
vintens, he struck out a path over the hills to Navares.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately the tanner was at home.  He was an
overgrown man whose bad humor evidently proceeded
from dyspepsia: and the monk did not envy the hapless
woman who had to subsist on his charity.  Eying
Antonio's boots and clothes with suspicion, the tanner
answered every question so curtly and sulkily that
Antonio at last showed spirit, and said:
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it will be better for me to employ a
notary?"
</p>

<p>
"Notary?  No, certainly not," gasped the tanner,
suddenly alarmed.  He was slothful in business; and
every lawyer within twenty miles knew him well as a
chronic defendant in the civil courts.
</p>

<p>
"I will give your Worship's mother-in-law one hundred
and fifty pounds for the whole property," said
Antonio, "provided the offer is accepted to-day."
</p>

<p>
"One hundred and fifty pounds?" snorted the tanner,
secretly overjoyed; "the Senhor is joking.  He means
three hundred; and even then I should be as good as
making him a present of the place."
</p>

<p>
Antonio, who had learned in Oporto and in London
to read the faces of men cleverer than the tanner, saw
that, even if he cut his offer down to a hundred and
twenty-five, he could still be sure of the farm.  But he
knew that a hundred and fifty was the fair price: and,
although he had denied himself a penn'orth of cheese
at breakfast, he was not going to make twenty-five
pounds out of a widow's extremity.
</p>

<p>
"Your Worship's presents are not wanted," he retorted
stiffly, taking up his hat.  "I said a hundred
and fifty.  I meant it.  I don't haggle.  Good day."
</p>

<p>
The tanner spluttered out a long speech, and finally
dragged Antonio upstairs into a stuffy little room
where his wife's mother was lying in bed with a black
rosary in her thin white hand.  He appealed to
Antonio, in the name of the commonest decency and
humanity, to avoid future prickings of conscience by
giving the ridiculous price of two hundred pounds for
the best farm in all Portugal, thus defrauding a dying
widow of a round hundred only.
</p>

<p>
"You may take it or leave it," said Antonio.  "One
hundred and fifty pounds, not a vintem more, not a
vintem less.  Stay.  The winter is coming, and the
Senhora's blood needs warming.  I come from a
wine-lodge in Oporto.  I have taken wines to England for
the King himself.  See.  Over and above the price, I
will send the Senhora ten pounds' worth of old
port-wine, and God grant it may do her good."
</p>

<p>
The aged sufferer looked up at the monk in thankful
astonishment.  She had been a personage in her time:
but deference and kindness had lately become so
unfamiliar that she had expected to die without encountering
them again.  Clutching her beads, she mumbled
at Antonio some words of gratitude and benediction.
</p>

<p>
The tanner was first greatly chagrined and afterwards
a little ashamed: and, at the foot of the stairs, he
agreed to his visitor's terms.  It was arranged that
Antonio should return at noon with a notary to
complete the purchase.  The cura of Navares, to whom the
monk had recourse, named a trustworthy man of law:
and by four o'clock the money had passed from
Antonio's belt to the tanner's cash-box, the necessary
documents had been signed, sealed, and delivered, and
the new owner was tramping back to the farm with the
keys in his pocket.
</p>

<p>
As in the cells and corridors of the great abbey, so
in the low rooms of the little farm-house the Portuguese
sun had counteracted the Portuguese rains, and
the place was clean and dry.  Some bulky chests, two
heavy tables, a dresser, and two wooden bedsteads had
been left behind, for the simple reason that the original
cabinet-maker had constructed them inside the house,
and there was no door or window wide enough for
their egress.  Antonio noted with satisfaction that two
or three pounds would buy all he required in the way of
linen, chairs, crockery, and household utensils.
</p>

<p>
Through want of irrigation the oranges on the trees
were small, sour, and hard.  Antonio, however, was
much more interested in the vines.  To an untrained
eye they would have seemed a hopeless intertanglement
of decaying leaves, with sparse bunches of withered
currants hiding here and there: but Antonio quickly
saw that skill and hard labor would reclaim them.
Better still, he found a three-acre patch of light arable
land which almost realized his ideal site for an entirely
new vineyard of bush-vines.  The wine-press, in one
of the outbuildings, had seen better days: but this did
not worry Antonio, as he was determined, in any case,
to import a new wine-making plant from Bordeaux.
</p>

<p>
Next morning the young farmer was early in the
saddle on his way to Villa Branca, ten leagues to the
east.  He had learned at Navares that Villa Branca
was the seat of a puissant official representing the
Fazenda, or Portuguese Exchequer, and that the
suppressed abbeys and monasteries of the district were
administered by this exalted personage.  He cantered
into Villa Branca with a clear proposal to make.
Would the Fazenda accept an annual rent of fifty
pounds for the abbey lands, at the same time giving
Antonio the option of buying the whole property, at the
end of ten years, for two thousand pounds?  If so he,
Antonio, would engage to cultivate the lands and to
keep the buildings in repair.
</p>

<p>
Although his ride was ten leagues long, the monk
reached the local offices of the Fazenda nearly an hour
earlier than the official, who lived a hundred yards
away.  The waiting-room was more than half filled
with high stacks of books, most of them in old calf
bindings.  A glance showed that these were the spoils
of monastic libraries, dumped down anyhow in the
Fazenda building until somebody from Lisbon should
arrive to divide them between the national and
municipal libraries.  Antonio picked up a volume at
random.  It was a sequence of Lenten meditations in
French; and the hand of some long dead Augustinian
had filled the fly-leaves with pious annotations.
Antonio was poring over this crabbed and faded script
when the Personage entered the room.
</p>

<p>
Had it been his first encounter with a highly-placed
civil servant, the monk would have concluded that the
Personage knew his secret; that his design, as an
ardent Benedictine religious, of restoring the abbey to
his Order was perfectly understood; and that the
haughtiness and suspiciousness of the Personage's
manner were accordingly explained.  But Antonio's
years in the world had made him familiar with the
masterfulness of the State's so-called servants and with
their rudeness to the hard-working people from whom
their excessive salaries were extracted.  So he kept his
temper, and even tried to commend his proposal by
stating it in studiously respectful language.
</p>

<p>
The Personage, leaving Antonio standing against a
pile of stolen books, listened with increasing impatience
and scorn: and, before the monk had finished, he
interrupted him to say that such a transaction was out
of the question; that the Minister would not listen to
it for a moment; that he, the Personage, had received
no instructions from Lisbon to press forward the sale
of this particular abbey; and that, when it came into
the market, the reserve price would be not less than
three thousand pounds, paid in cash, once for all,
forthwith.
</p>

<p>
Antonio tried in vain to argue.  He exhibited the
fifty pounds, which he had brought with him as a first
installment, to cold eyes; for the Personage saw no
way of sticking to the money himself.  The deeds of
the little farm, which Antonio was for showing as
proofs that he was a man of substance, were waved
aside; and when he began to speak of giving references
to solid and reputable citizens of Oporto and London,
the Personage had ceased to listen.  A bell rang, a
clerk appeared, some remarks were exchanged, and
Antonio, without being able to say that he had received
insults or even inattention, somehow found himself in
the glaring street.
</p>

<p>
He rode home with a troubled face.  Righteous anger,
bitter disappointment, gnawing fear possessed him
in turn.  But, as he entered his little home and began
to unpack the few things he had bought for its
furnishing, his spirits rose.  The knife and fork with which
he ate his plain supper had wooden handles; his goblet
was of almost opaque glass an eighth of an inch thick;
the coarse tablecloth was more brown than white, and
his lamp was a candle stuck in a bottle.  Nevertheless
he supped happily, even gaily; and it was with
sustained fervor that he recited what remained of his
Office.
</p>

<p>
Strenuous days followed.  From the late November
sunrise to the early November sunset Antonio labored
harder than a navvy.  The making of the new vineyard
was his principal care: and by the end of the year
the toughest part of the job had been soundly done.
Only on a Sunday did the toiler rest from his labors.
On the morning of that day he would hear Mass in the
over-gilded village church; and, in the evening, when
darkness fell, he would crawl along the torrent's bed
into the abbey kitchen, and thence steal softly to his old
stall in the chapel.  There he would recite Compline
from memory: and afterwards, prostrate before the
empty tabernacle, he would beseech his Lord to fulfil
those last and grandest words of the Abbot's prophecy:
"I see Antonio standing before the high altar.  I see
him holding up our great chalice.  I see him offering
the Holy Sacrifice for us all."

<h3>
I
</h3>

<p>
Towards nightfall on the feast of the Three Kings
the heavens were opened.  From every inch of the
somber sky descended cold, straight rain until the
roads were rivers and the hill-sides began to sing.
</p>

<p>
When the storm burst Antonio was in the abbey
chapel, saying Vespers in his old stall.  He had duly
observed the great festival of the Epiphany, abstaining
from servile work and hearing Mass at the village:
and, as on Sundays, he was rounding off the holy day
by saying his Office in the choir.  But the vehemence
of the storm alarmed him.  He rose hastily, and made
his way through the darkling cloisters and corridors.
</p>

<p>
As he neared the kitchen a roaring sound filled
Antonio's startled ears.  It was the torrent.  Although
he had rammed the sluice-gate well home only half an
hour before, the stream was racing through the kitchen
in a foaming flood.
</p>

<p>
"The sluice-gate has broken," said Antonio to
himself.  "The timbers must have rotted all of a sudden.
But there's just time to get out."
</p>

<p>
Only the faintest light gleamed through the tunnel
under the refectory.  By lying on his chest upon the
stones Antonio could just see the leaden sky.  He
could see, too, that the water was rising higher and
higher, and that the space between the level of the
water and the center of the tunnel vaulting was less
than two feet.
</p>

<p>
The monk flung off his habit and jumped down into
the torrent.  It almost touched his arm-pits.  The
waters were icy cold; but this troubled him less than
their headlong violence which threatened to sweep him
away.
</p>

<p>
He entered the tunnel.  As it was barely five feet
from floor to keystone, the broad-shouldered giant had
to hump his back and to work himself along in a frog-like
posture.  More than once stones, bowled along by
the force of the flood, struck cruelly at his feet and
ankles, and it was only by clutching with bleeding
fingers at the sides of the vault that he could make the
smallest headway.  Even while he was escaping from
it the water went on rising: and it was with dripping
locks, and with eyes and ears full of muddy water,
that he finally broke out into the free air.
</p>

<p>
The rain was pouring down so torrentially as he
climbed up to the bank that he would have been as
dry in the middle of the stream.  As for his clothes,
which he had rolled up as usual and laid behind a
bush, he knew they must be wetter than his skin.
Still, there was nothing for it but to scramble into
them and dash for home.  Antonio stooped to pick
up the bundle.
</p>

<p>
It was gone.
</p>

<p>
In a flash he knew that Man as well as Nature had
come to fight him.  The instinct of danger made him
spring back from the water and clench both fists to
strike.  And he had hardly a second to wait Like a
beast from its lair, a black body sprang at him out of
the pouring trees.
</p>

<p>
The staggering suddenness of its onslaught nearly
flung Antonio to the ground.  Before he knew what
was happening, his assailant had dragged him to within
a yard of the stream's edge and was making ready to
shove him into the swirling water.  But the monk got
his grip just in time; and the stranger, fearful of
meeting the end he had planned for Antonio, lurched
back over the sodden grass.
</p>

<p>
Locked together, both men paused for breath.  In
one point Antonio had the advantage.  He was at
ease in thin cotton undergarments, while his adversary
was encumbered by soaked garments of peasant stuff
and cut.  On the other hand, the stranger was fresh
for the fray, whereas Antonio's battling against the
flood in the tunnel had broken his wind.  Meanwhile,
to cool them for the second round, the stinging rain
thrashed down impatiently upon them both.
</p>

<p>
With a tremendous rally of strength Antonio hurled
the other away from him and then rushed in like lightning
to get a better grip.  He succeeded; and little by
little he began to crush his foe down upon the sloppy
ground.  He had no relish for manslaughter even in
self-defense; and, instead of thrusting him into the
stream, he sought only to pin the stranger down with
hands and knees and to make him give satisfaction for
his murderous onrush.  But the monk's strength
began to fail him.  His half-frozen feet were
bleeding, his heart was thumping against his ribs, the
veins on his forehead stood out like thick string, and
his breath came and went in quick, thick gasps.
</p>

<p>
The stranger felt his opportunity; and, inch by inch,
Antonio was dragged, pushed, shouldered, butted,
elbowed, kneed back to the torrent's brim.  But the
ground was slippery: and both the wrestlers slithered
and crashed down heavily.
</p>

<p>
They were up again in a twinkling, facing each
other with intent eyes.  The stranger's shoulders were
bent and his hands touched his knees as he crouched
for a second spring.  At the sight of him a white flash
of memory blazed across Antonio's mind.  Those
tigerish eyes, those hunched shoulders, those great,
terrible hands outspread upon those clumsy knees&mdash;he
had seen them all before.  By this time his eyes were
used to the dusk and mist, and he knew he was not
deceived: for he could discern a wound on the
peasant's cheek.  Before the other had time to make his
pounce, the monk cried out in imperious tones:
</p>

<p>
"Hold.  I know you.  We are friends!"
</p>

<p>
"Friends?" hissed the stranger.  "Pretty friends!
I don't make friends with thieves and atheists."
</p>

<p>
All the same, his taut muscles relaxed.  Antonio's
tone had awed him a little, and Antonio's words had
puzzled him a great deal.  His shoulders unbent and
he did not spring.
</p>

<p>
"I am not an atheist and I am not a thief," said
Antonio sternly.  "But even thieves and atheists are not
so bad as murderers.  Why have you tried to drown
me in this torrent?"
</p>

<p>
"Because you're a spy and a blasphemer and a
robber."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me your name," the monk demanded.  And
when the other only responded by a threatening
gesture he added: "Never mind.  I know it already.
You are called José.  You live at Pedrinha das
Areias."
</p>

<p>
The peasant's clenched hands dropped open at his
sides, and he gave a low cry of astonishment and
fright.
</p>

<p>
"You fought with Dom Pedro at the siege of
Oporto," continued the monk.  "It was there you lost
two fingers from your left hand.  Wait.  I haven't
finished.  Nearly four years ago you were one of the
troop which came to drive the monks out of this
abbey.  You were sent back home for quarreling with
another soldier about religion.  You rode back to
Oliveira on your own horse.  Now, I ask you again, why
have you tried to murder me?"
</p>

<p>
"It's a lie that I came here to drive out monks,"
cried the peasant, nearly choking with anger.  "I
didn't know we'd been sent on such dirty work."
</p>

<p>
"Why have you tried to murder me?"
</p>

<p>
"Because ... because you're in the pay of
that accursed Viscount.  Murder you?  Yes, God
helping me, I'll do it this minute!"
</p>

<p>
"God is not helping you, and you won't do it this
minute," said Antonio calmly.  "Now that I've got
back my wind you haven't a ghost of a chance.  You
lost two fingers fighting, like a brave man, at Oporto.
Understand.  If there's no other way, I shall have to
twist either your right wrist or your left ankle to
keep you quiet.  So&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
His mouth was stopped by José's lightning
onslaught.  Once more they rocked to and fro in a
terrible embrace.  But Antonio had spoken the truth.
His wind had come back, and there was no chance for
José.  Within forty seconds the monk had his man
fairly down.  He pinned him, face upwards, on the
grass, kneeling upon his thighs and gripping his
shoulders with hands like steel.  And all the time the
streaming rain came pouring, pouring, pouring down.
</p>

<p>
"José," began Antonio, in a voice of infinite pity
and kindness, "my poor friend&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
A horrible imprecation broke from the writhing
peasant.  It was the more frightful to hear because it
so evidently came from lips which rarely cursed or
swore.
</p>

<p>
"José," the monk commanded, altering his tone, "in
the name of Jesus Christ I charge you to listen.  I am
your friend.  I am not in the pay of the Viscount of
Ponte Quebrada.  I was in the abbey to-night simply
to pray and to worship God."
</p>

<p>
But José was staring at him with wide eyes.  The
hatred had died out of his face, and he struggled
hard to seize some elusive memory.  Suddenly he
cried:
</p>

<p>
"Tell me.  That night.  There were young monks,
two monks, at the gate.  One coughed and was like
death.  The other ..."
</p>

<p>
He paused and looked at Antonio with eyes that
yearned.  The monk started.  If he answered, his
secret would be out.  Yet how could he be silent?  An
inward voice bade him answer freely.
</p>

<p>
"I was the other monk," he said.  "In the monastery
they called me Father Antonio."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke he released his captive and stood up.
José stumbled to his feet like a man dazed, and faced
Antonio in the rain with bent head and fidgeting
hands.
</p>

<p>
"Give me my clothes," ordered the monk.
</p>

<p>
The peasant drew forth an almost dry bundle of
clothes from a hollow tree and would have helped
Antonio to put them on.  But the monk waved him aside
and was soon inside the garments.
</p>

<p>
"Follow me," he said.
</p>

<p>
In spite of his bleeding feet he set a breakneck pace
down the hill.  At the boundary wall of the abbey,
where the torrent foamed through the broken arch, he
halted; and if the pair had not been able to leap from
boulder to boulder like mountain-goats they could not
have regained the open heath.  The night grew
blacker; and twice or thrice, where there were patches
of clay, they slipped and fell.  But no bones were
broken; and in less than three quarters of an hour
from the beginning of their fight the two men were at
Antonio's door.
</p>

<h3>
II
</h3>

<p>
The heap of pine-cones burning on Antonio's narrow
hearth crackled pleasantly and gave out fragrant
vapors.  But, as the monk crouched over it chafing his
nerveless hands, he could not help thinking of the
blaze he had seen in the vast fireplace of a famous old
English banqueting-hall at the close of a chilly, rainy
day.  The recollection increased his resentment
against the shaggy José, who was waiting for his new
master's word as meekly as a drenched sheep-dog on
a moor.  Antonio's pity was submerged for the moment
under his disgust at having had to fight for life,
half-naked, in a tropical downpour.
</p>

<p>
"Here are some dry clothes," he said sharply, opening
a chest and throwing out the suit in which he had
ridden to Villa Branca.  And, while José was changing,
he stamped upstairs to do the same.
</p>

<p>
Antonio boasted three suits in all.  The oldest was
the dripping raiment he was actually wearing&mdash;the
clothes which José had bundled into the hollow tree.
The second was the suit he had lent to his guest.  The
third was the masterpiece in broadcloth which a
London tailor had made at the expense of Messrs. Crowberry
and Castro for Antonio's memorable journey.
Over and above these the monk possessed his habit.
</p>

<p>
It was a choice between the patched, rusty-black
habit or the fine gentleman's broadcloth.  Antonio
hesitated.  At last he put on the habit and returned
to the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
José, awkward in his town-made clothes, stood
waiting.  From the extreme of bloodthirstiness he had
passed to the extreme of sheepishness: and, as Antonio
entered in his monkish garb, he retreated a step and
went down clumsily on his knees as if he saw a priest
on his way to the altar.
</p>

<p>
"Get up," said Antonio.  "I am wearing my monk's
habit simply because my clothes are wet.  Get up.
Nearer the fire.  Sit down.  Tell me why you were at
the abbey to-night."
</p>

<p>
José got up and approached the hearth, where he
seated himself on the keg which was Antonio's second-best
stool.  But he remained tongue-tied.  The monk
repeated his question.
</p>

<p>
"Your Reverence&mdash;" began José.  Then his tongue
was tied once more.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind 'Your Reverence' just now," said
Antonio, more kindly.  "Tell me a plain tale.  What
were you doing at the abbey?  Why did you try to
drown me before you gave me a chance to explain?
It is a serious matter.  If I'd been a weaker man, at
this moment you would be a murderer."
</p>

<p>
"I did wrong, Father," said José humbly.  "But
God knows I thought I was doing right.  I thought
your Reverence had found out about the things and
that he'd come to steal them."
</p>

<p>
"What things?"
</p>

<p>
"The things the Viscount of Pont' Quebrad' buried
in the ground."
</p>

<p>
Antonio started violently.  He paced the room.
Then he hurried back to the fireside and said:
</p>

<p>
"Wait.  We must understand one another.  When
we monks were driven out, all those things were still
in the sacristy.  All I know about the Viscount burying
them in the ground is this.  One night in Oporto
a gentleman from Lisbon told me that the Viscount
and the captain had pretended to bury them.  He said
the Viscount was a wonderful play-actor.  But he told
me that all Lisbon believed he had never buried them
at all.  He had smuggled them out of the country."
</p>

<p>
"That's what everybody thinks, Father," said
José, so eagerly that his tongue was fairly loosened.
"And the Viscount had to leave Portugal.  But he
didn't steal the things at all.  Only he tried to: so he
deserved to be punished all the same.  Didn't he,
Father?"
</p>

<p>
"He did.  But I don't understand."
</p>

<p>
"It was this way, Father.  The captain&mdash;may God
bless him, he was a fine man till he met the Viscount&mdash;the
captain, he ordered me to go home.  That night
I rode as far as Oliveira, five leagues from Pedrinha.
There I found that my mother was dead.  May God
rest her soul!  I felt I couldn't go home; so I sold my
horse in Oliveira for sixty-seven milreis.  I only got
two milreis for the saddle because it belonged to the
Government.  Still, they owed me my pay, didn't
they, Father?"
</p>

<p>
"Get on, get on," snapped Antonio.  "What has all
this to do with the Viscount and the things?"
</p>

<p>
"When I'd sold the horse I came back to the abbey.
I wanted to see what became of the monks and whether
the Viscount would beat the Abbot.  It took me all
day, tracking over the mountains.  In the middle of
the afternoon I saw the monks down at the bottom of
the hill marching to Navares, with some of our men on
horses.  But I didn't turn back.  I had a score to
settle with Sergeant Carvalho, if he hadn't gone to
Navares.  It was all on account of Ferreira, the fat
corporal.  Only myself knows how&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You came back to the abbey over the mountains.
Go on."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't dare walk in at the gates, so I waited till
it was dark and climbed the wall in the wood behind
what they call the guest-house.  It was nearly
midnight.  As I got near the guest-house, I heard voices
among the trees.  There were two men, with a dark
lantern."
</p>

<p>
"The Viscount and the captain?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Father.  They were digging, in their shirtsleeves,
only the captain was doing all the work.  I
thought it was strange, Father; so I crawled along
softly and hid myself where I could see what they
were doing.  When the hole was dug they went into
the trees.  The Viscount trod on the brim of my hat,
but he didn't see it.  They came back with some flat
boxes and put them in the hole.  The captain went to
work very hard to fill the hole up again; but the
Viscount swore at him and said: 'The more dirt you chuck
in now the more we shall have to shovel out to-morrow
night.'  So they filled it in loose and covered it up with
dead leaves.  Then they hid the spades in the bushes
and went away."
</p>

<p>
"And you didn't?"
</p>

<p>
"I stayed, Father.  I knew they had been burying
what was not theirs.  So I found one of the spades
and unburied the boxes and carried them on my head
to a sand-pit that I'd tumbled into when I climbed over
the wall.  I buried them there, in loose sand, where
one place looked just like another."
</p>

<p>
"That was clever," said Antonio.  "Go on."
</p>

<p>
"All the next day I lay hiding, with only one piece
of bread to eat and water to drink.  But I was glad I
hadn't gone away.  At night they came again, with
ropes and canvas.  They began talking about some
mules, and the Viscount kept mentioning a name that
I can't remember; only I know it wasn't Portuguese.
Then they raked off the dead leaves and started
digging.  But, oh, Father!  I wonder they didn't find me
and skin me alive, because when they saw the hole was
empty, I nearly burst myself to keep from laughing.
They would have heard me, sure enough, if they
hadn't fallen to quarreling.  In the end the Viscount
said the captain had stolen a march on him, and he
called him a&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind what he called him."
</p>

<p>
"At that the captain struck the Viscount in the face.
I was frightened then.  I thought there was going to
be murder.  But all of a sudden they made up the
quarrel and the captain said: 'What are we going to
do?'  The Viscount said: 'Those thieves of monks
have hidden it, and we'll find it, or some of them shall
swing for it.'  But the captain said: 'What if we
can't find it?  What about the Government?'  The
Viscount said: 'That's easy.  When the van and the
men come from Lisbon we'll bring them to this hole.
We can take our Bible oath, both of us, that we buried
it here ourselves, for fear of treachery among the men:
and we can swear that we haven't the ghost of an idea
who has taken it away.  But we'll find it to-night if
we search till morning; and next week it shall be in
England, safe and sound.'  Then they took the
lantern to begin hunting: so I picked myself up and
slipped off to the sand-pit."
</p>

<p>
"And they didn't follow?"
</p>

<p>
"Not at once, Father.  They did not come there till
day-break.  But the sun the day before had dried all
the sand the same color.  They stuck in sticks both
sides of the right place: but they didn't find it."
</p>

<p>
José ceased.
</p>

<p>
"And what happened next?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, Father.  Some say the Marquis
almost made people believe he was dumbfounded when
the new soldiers from Lisbon dug in the hole.  But
that can't be right; because he left the hole open.  I
only know that people said he had never put the
things in the hole at all, and he had to leave Portugal,
and the captain was turned out of the army.  That's
all."
</p>

<p>
Antonio took two more turns up and down the room
before he demanded:
</p>

<p>
"Where are the things now?"
</p>

<p>
José's face clouded; and his eyes, which had burned
brightly with excitement during his recital, were
suddenly dulled by trouble.  A few moments later he
became visibly ashamed of his suspiciousness, and he
would have begun stammering a speech if Antonio,
who could read the whole of his simple mind, had not
said:
</p>

<p>
"Wait.  I understand.  You believe our Lord sent
you to snatch back His own from wicked men.  For
nearly four years you have guarded the treasure like a
faithful watch-dog, and now you hesitate to trust me.
It is natural."
</p>

<p>
José stared in wonder at this mysterious monk,
who knew his thoughts even better than he knew
them himself.
</p>

<p>
"But listen," Antonio went on.  "For nearly four
years I too have guarded a secret.  The night when
you dug up the boxes, José, that same night was the
last night the world saw me as a monk.  Like you, I
lay all that night under the trees.  Since then the
world has known me as a clerk, a wine-grower, a
commercial traveler, a farmer.  But to-night, as soon as
you asked me for my secret, I gave it.  You are the
only man in the world who knows that the owner of
this little farm is the monk Antonio.  Still, although
I've told you my secret, that does not force you to tell
me yours."
</p>

<p>
José stirred uneasily.
</p>

<p>
"This is what I propose," concluded Antonio.  "I
will swear to you, here and now, a solemn oath that if
you tell me your secret I will never reveal it until the
monks return.  And you, on your part, shall swear
that you will not breathe a hint of my own secret to a
living soul."
</p>

<p>
"The things are buried in the cloister," José blurted
out.  "There are graves there, under the stones, but
they haven't all got monks inside.  I lifted up a
gravestone with no printing on it and I put the boxes in.
It's on the north side, to the left, just opposite the
little Moses in the bulrushes."
</p>

<p>
"I thank you, José, and I admire you," said Antonio,
pressing the huge hand.  "All the same, we will
swear our oaths.  It will make both of us easier in our
minds."
</p>

<p>
A small book of the Gospels, printed in the vernacular,
lay on the table.  Antonio placed his hand upon
it, and swore in clear words and solemn tones that he
would keep the secret of the buried boxes.  The oath
he dictated to José was longer and more picturesque.
Before framing it he elicited the names of the saints
whom José's family had most delighted to honor.
Eventually the young peasant swore himself to secrecy
by the holy Gospels; by the true faith of a Christian;
by Nossa Senhora dos Remedios de Lamego; by San
Torquato of Guimarães; by San Braz; by San Pedro
d' Alcantará; by the Pope's three crowns; by his
mother's memory; and by his own hopes of eternal
salvation.  Antonio felt a qualm or two in enouncing
such a formula: but did not the success of his life's
work demand that José should be held back from his
own impulsiveness by every chain his faith could
forge?
</p>

<p>
When the oaths had been sworn, Antonio went to
the door.  The rain had ceased and a few stars were
glinting weakly in the watery sky.
</p>

<p>
"Hadn't you better go, while it is fair?" he said to
José.  "Never mind about the clothes.  Bring them
back when your own are dry, and we will finish our
talk."
</p>

<p>
But José did not hasten forth.  "If you please,
Father," he said awkwardly, "I'd ... I'd
rather stay here."
</p>

<p>
"Stay here?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I'd like to be your servant, Father.  And
I'd like to learn to be a monk."
</p>

<p>
Antonio stopped on the brink of half-derisive,
half-angry laughter.  He remembered the apostle's
injunction: "Strengthen the feeble-minded."  This
dull-witted hind had acted, after all, like a Christian hero;
and Antonio suddenly said to himself: "He has the
mind of a little child; but of such are the Kingdom of
Heaven."
</p>

<p>
"A monk, José?" he echoed, kindly.  "Not yet, I
fear.  Why, only to-night you tried to murder me.
Even Saint Dominic, who founded his Order to fight
against the enemies of our religion, would not have
approved of you up there in the rain.  But you say
you would be my servant.  How?  What about your
own farm?"
</p>

<p>
"They cheated me out of it, Father&mdash;the lawyers.
I got only two hundred milreis.  I work at a cooper's
in Navares: but it is all indoors, and trade is so slack
he only keeps me on out of charity.  He would be
glad if I didn't darken the door again.  I would like
to be your servant."
</p>

<p>
Antonio walked once more to the door and looked
out.  The sky was clearing.  High in the East,
encircled by creamy cloud-banks, he could see one stretch
of blue, as blue as a tarn set deep in mountain snows;
and in the midst of it shone a great soft star.  Then
he remembered that this was the feast of the Three
Kings.  He recalled the antiphon he had recited in
the day's Office, <i>Stella ista sicut flamma coruscat</i>:
"Like as a flame doth that Star sparkle and showeth
God, the King of Kings.  The Wise Men beheld it,
and to the great King they offered their gifts."  Ought
he, Antonio, to offer as gifts to the King his
dearly-prized solitude, his monastic silence, his
studious privacy, in order that he might reward this simple
soul and shield it from the world?  He first bowed his
head; then raised it to the star, craving heavenly light.
</p>

<p>
"Can I stay, Father?" persisted José, doggedly.
</p>

<p>
"You can stay," said Antonio, with his eyes still
fixed on the star in the East.
</p>

III
</h3>

<p>
José stayed.  Before February came in, he was a
changed man.  The unshared secret of the buried
boxes had been too big and too heavy for his rustic
wits, and had forced him into an unnatural attitude of
taciturnity and suspiciousness.  But no sooner had he
shifted the burden of responsibility to Antonio's broad
shoulders than his innate gaiety returned.  The war,
his wounds, his mother's death, and the loss of his
farm had conspired to congeal José's heart and to seal
his lips; and for years he had not sung a song right
through.  But one sunny morning, as he was working
among the orange-trees, a knot in his brain seemed to
slip free, and he began to pipe like a bird.
</p>

<p>
Antonio did not regret his sacrifice.  José was an
all-round farmer, with an eagerness for work which
made him worth his weight in silver.  In his native
parish of Pedrinha das Areias he had learned the art
of treating vines after the fashion of the growers in
Collares, the famous vine-land near Cintra.  In order
to profit by his skill, Antonio bought, for thirty
pounds, a straggling parcel of land alongside the
Atlantic.  There José and he planted chosen vines.  The
leafless canes, protruding from the sand, wore a
hopeless look in winter: but they were well-rooted in the
subsoil, and, when the summer suns began to burn, a
covering of sand six feet thick kept the roots so moist
and cool that the leaves were green and fresh long after
the other vines looked parched and dry.
</p>

<p>
Antonio, however, was grateful for José not only as
a farm-servant, a fellow-vintner, and a cooper.  More
than once, while the peasant's cheerful voice was
caroling out old songs of love and war, Antonio found
himself saying, "Non est bonum esse hominem solunt:
'It is not good for man to be alone.'  After all, I am a
monk and not a hermit."
</p>

<p>
José's quarters were in the outbuildings, where he
enjoyed a bedroom much larger and more cheerful
than his master's.  He ate his morning meal alone:
but, when the day's work was over, the two men dined
together in the principal room of the farm-house.
Dinner was always served ceremoniously.  Even on
fast-days, when it was merely an eight-ounce supper
of wine and dark bread, both master and servant put
on black coats and soft white collars.  After dinner
Antonio generally sat down to read.  He subscribed
to two English periodicals&mdash;a weekly paper and a
quarterly review&mdash;so that, in the event of his visiting
England again, he might not be out of touch with his
hosts' thought and life.  Meanwhile José would sit
near the lamp or the window, carving one of the new
bits of furniture with which he was gradually beautifying
the little house.  Later in the evening, a blackboard
was produced and Antonio proceeded with
José's education.
</p>

<p>
As a schoolmaster Antonio was unconventional.
José could neither read nor write his native language:
but the monk began by teaching him Latin.  He
taught José to form large capital letters, which came
much easier than a cursive script to his rough hands.
At the very first lesson the pupil learned how to write,
spell, and pronounce <i>pater</i> and <i>mater</i>, and how to
translate these words in the light of the Portuguese
<i>padre</i> and <i>madre</i>.  Within a week, having mastered
the present indicative of <i>amo</i> and also the first and
second declensions of nouns, he could print on the
board <i>Pater amat filium</i>, with the Portuguese equivalent
<i>O padre ama o filho</i> in the line below.  Antonio
omitted mention of exceptional genders or inflexions,
and discreetly concealed the existence of the subjunctive
mood.  He did not attempt to impart the Latin
of Cicero but only a rough-and-ready <i>lingua rustica</i>
which he hoped to polish at his leisure into the
language of the Missal and the Breviary.
</p>

<p>
Pride in his classical scholarship led José, one day of
Lent, into an indiscretion.  Upon a barn-door he
carved deeply with his knife "Pater Antonius" in big
letters and "Josephus" in smaller characters
underneath.  Antonio made him place a new panel in the
door, after cutting out and burning the old one; and,
at the same time, he reminded him sternly how he had
sworn never to let fall the remotest hint that his
master was a monk.
</p>

<p>
To guard against any fatal slip of José's tongue,
Antonio forbade his servant from that hour to call
him Father in any circumstances whatsoever.  José's
face fell, and he said dolefully:
</p>

<p>
"I'd been hoping, Father&mdash;I mean, Senhor&mdash;to
make my Easter confession to your Reverence&mdash;I
mean, to your Worship.  Yes, and I'd been hoping
that your Rever&mdash;that your Worship might be saying
his Easter Mass in the abbey chapel and that I might
serve it."
</p>

<p>
Antonio knew that he would only bewilder the
honest fellow's mind if he attempted to explain
confessors' faculties; and that it would be still worse to
admit that he, though a choir-monk, had not yet said
his first Mass.  So he simply shook his head, and
replied:
</p>

<p>
"No, José, we must fulfil our Easter duties, both of
us, in the parish church.  These are bad times for
monks in Portugal.  And remember, above all, that
you must give up calling me 'Your Reverence' and
'Father.'"
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless the priest allowed the layman to share
much of his religious life.  Before they parted for the
night they told their beads antiphonally.  At dinner,
when Antonio had said his Order's two-word grace
before meat, <i>Benedictus benedicat</i>, he would edify José
by relating some miracle or heroic act of the saint for
the day.  On the mornings of Sundays and days of
obligation they tramped to the parish Mass together;
and in the evenings they stole into the dim abbey and
performed their pious exercises in choir.
</p>

<p>
In the autumn of that year the two men pressed
seventeen pipes of rough wine.  After putting aside
two pipes for their own consumption they sold off the
remainder for fourteen pounds.  As a result of grafting
upon old roots Antonio also pressed about a dozen
gallons of good wine for his great experiment.  This
pressing he jealously cellared in a little cask, of José's
making, which had been for months under daily treatment
so that the wood should help rather than hurt the
wine.  Of course, the new vineyard on the sea-shore
was too young to yield a harvest: but the plants waxed
and throve exceedingly.
</p>

<p>
While Antonio was thus busied, another vintage was
going forward almost under his eyes.  One morning,
about the middle of September, José rushed into the
kitchen exclaiming that two women and three men
were openly and calmly picking the grapes in the
neglected vineyards of the abbey, and that they had
somehow opened the outbuildings where the
wine-presses and vats were stored.
</p>

<p>
Antonio paced up and down the kitchen twenty
times before he could come to a decision.  As the
secret guardian of the abbey, he could not ignore these
trespassers, who, if they were unchallenged, might
easily grow bolder until they committed some act of
desecration.  On the other hand, there were dangers
attending his interference with people who might turn
out to be acting in a legal manner.  He decided,
however, to go up to the abbey and use his own eyes.
Before setting out he slipped into his pocket a good
Havana cigar, one of a boxful which had been pressed
upon him in England.
</p>

<p>
The foreman of the vintagers was sitting in the
shade of the monastery buildings, smoking a pipe of
Brazilian tobacco.
</p>

<p>
"Good days, Senhor," said Antonio in a friendly
tone.  "Your Worship is luckier than I am.  I made
the Fazenda an offer for this vineyard, and they
didn't even ask me to sit down."
</p>

<p>
"The Ministerio da Fazenda in Lisbon?" asked the
foreman.
</p>

<p>
"No, in Villa Branca."
</p>

<p>
The foreman laughed a meaning laugh, Antonio
changed his ground.
</p>

<p>
"We're pressing about twenty pipes down there in
the valley," he said pointing out the farm.  "But it's
poor stuff.  The vines have been neglected for years."
</p>

<p>
"So have these," the foreman grumbled.  "Yet
we're expected to take home wine fit for the Queen."
</p>

<p>
Antonio described his experiment in the vineyard on
the sea-shore, and asked for the foreman's opinion and
advice so deferentially that the man was pleased and
flattered.  When the monk rose to go the foreman
suddenly said:
</p>

<p>
"The Senhor mustn't say I told him.  But I
don't wonder the chief of the Fazenda at Villa Branca
bowed him out.  The chief takes every grape in this
vineyard every year, by his own authority, without
paying a vintem to anybody.  That's how Portugal
is robbed.  We might as well have Dom Miguel back
again."
</p>

<p>
A burden rolled from Antonio's heart.  So long as
the Villa Branca official had an interest in snubbing off
possible leasers or buyers the monastery would be safe.
He readily promised never to reveal the source from
which he had learned so spicy a secret; and, after
deeply impressing the foreman by giving him a cigar
which had truly seen both Cuba and England, he
returned home.
</p>

<p>
The day Antonio received payment for the sale of
his rough wine he tendered José his wages.  In rural
Portugal a servant's annual wages ranged from four
and a half to five and a half pounds a year, with the
addition of a coarse cloak every second year.  Antonio
offered José the price of a cloak and five pounds.
</p>

<p>
"This money," said José, holding it in his hand, "is
taken from your Worship's savings&mdash;the money that's
to buy back the abbey?"
</p>

<p>
"It is your own, fairly earned," the monk responded.
"Mind you don't lose it.  Have you a safe place
to keep it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said José promptly.  "I shall bury it."
</p>

<p>
Antonio laughed.  "You're like a fox," he said.
"How many cemeteries have you?"
</p>

<p>
With some pride, José admitted, in mysterious
tones, that he had three distinct and untraceable
hiding-places, not counting the grave in the abbey-cloisters
where he had buried the boxes.  Becoming more at
ease, he finally asked leave to ease his mind of an
oppressive secret.  Deep in a drift of sand near the new
vineyard he had laid away one hundred pounds&mdash;the
round remainder of moneys he had received for his
horse and his farm and from a small legacy.  Blushing
at his own presumption, he begged Antonio to let
him add this sum to the English pounds which his
master was hording up for the abbey's redemption.
Antonio, deeply touched, agreed to accept the money:
but only on condition that José should be allowed a
clear year in which to alter his mind.
</p>

<p>
Had Antonio been giving one hundred pounds instead
of receiving it, José could not have been more
grateful.  But he had still something to ask.
</p>

<p>
"Since I saw those men and women up there in the
vineyard, I'm not easy at nights," he said.  "I'm
thinking the boxes ought to be buried in our own
garden.  And, if I can have the cart and the bullock,
I'll dig up everything that I've got and bring it here."
</p>

<p>
During the next dark night the two men opened the
grave in the cloisters and brought away the boxes,
which they reburied in a dry place within sight of
José's window.  The morning after, José set out in the
bullock-cart, with a spade, a dark lantern, some
sacking, and two empty barrels hidden under a heap of
straw.
</p>

<p>
He was away two days.  When he returned it was
with so abashed an air that Antonio thought the hiding
places had been found empty.  But the lifting of the
straw told a different tale.  Although José had lost his
farm, he had saved the household gods and heirlooms.
There were two carved coffers filled with fine linen; a
box of old Portuguese faience in which the Persian
influence was still strong; five musty books of fusty
piety; a fowling-piece, much more dangerous to the
sportsman than to the game; and some great, round,
solid, honest vessels of copper and pewter which shone,
after José had polished them, like suns and moons.
</p>

<h3>
IV
</h3>

<p>
Three years' hard labor turned Antonio's tangled
vineyards and languishing orangeries into an earthly
paradise.  The red roses nearly covering the white
walls of his golden-thatched farm-house, the round
plot of well-kept turf in front, the bright flower-beds
and the trim gate, gave quite an English appearance to
the little farmstead.  All the potsherds and rubbish
had been removed from the bed of the stream, while
the cascades and pools had been made fewer and
grander.  Trellises, pergolas, and arches everywhere
showed that José had been no less industrious than his
master.
</p>

<p>
Up in the village the gossips had plenty of news to
keep them busy.  The successive arrivals of Antonio's
wine-press from France, of his vine-slips from
vineyards all over Europe, and of his books and papers
from England were so many nine-days' wonders.
Fifty wild stories were set going as to his parentage,
his past, and his prospects: but it never entered
anybody's head that he had dwelt for years, almost in their
midst, as a monk of Saint Benedict.
</p>

<p>
Antonio was regular in church-attendance: but he
took care to conceal nearly all his piety.  For example,
he denied himself the consolation of occasionally
serving the cura's Mass, lest his good Latin and his
intelligent grasp of every point in the ritual should betray
him.  He communicated more frequently than was
usual in the parish: but no one ever thought of
numbering him among those few devotees in the village
who were profanely called <i>os beatos e as beatas</i>&mdash;the
Saints and Blessed Ones.
</p>

<p>
What interested the parish much more than Antonio's
religion was Antonio's prosperity.  It became
known that every hectare of his long-neglected
vineyard was earning a hundred per cent more than any
other hectare within ten leagues.  It was also known
that he was distilling a new kind of orange brandy for
medicinal use, which he exported to Rio de Janeiro at
a high price.  Rumor said that, when his sea-sand
vineyard should begin to bear fruit, Collares would
sink to the second place.  Most wonderful of all, it
was known that the cellars at Antonio's farm contained
some curious wooden racks in which two or three
hundred bottles of blended white wine were standing on
their heads.  This blended white wine, according to a
villager who did occasional work at the farm under
José, was intended to rival French champagne, a
famous but mysterious beverage which no native of the
parish had ever drunk or seen.
</p>

<p>
Upon the undeniable fact of Antonio's prosperity
the gossips naturally proceeded to erect fantastic
prophecies about his matrimonial intentions.  No
tongues wagged concerning José.  Had the gossips
known of his hundred pounds, his copper and pewter
and fine linen, the case would have been different; but,
if they thought of him at all, they regarded him as a
wild-eyed, eccentric boor who might go mad at any
moment, and was certainly better without a wife to
beat or murder.  Antonio, however, was worth the
gossips' while.  During his first year in the parish they
mentally married him off to Joanna Quintella, a widow
who had lost her husband in the civil wars.  Joanna
was hardly thirty, had not outlived all her good looks,
and was possessed of nearly sixty pounds.
</p>

<p>
This was just after the monk had sold off his first
pressing of wine for fourteen pounds.  But, with the
growth of his prosperity, his prospective brides
advanced in importance.  The gossips jilted poor
Joanna and betrothed Antonio successively to Catharina
Rodrigues de Barros Lopes, the farrier's second
daughter; to Maria da Conceiçao d'Araujo, the cura's
younger sister; and to Beatriz Amelia Martins, who
had lived six months in Lisbon with her sister, the wife
of a customs-house officer.  But when it leaked out
that Antonio went nearly every month to the bank in
Villa Branca with drafts from Oporto, Rio de Janeiro,
and even London, the match with Donna Beatriz was
broken off.
</p>

<p>
Within the wide boundaries of the parish only one
bride remained: but, for a time, not one of the gossips
was presumptuous enough to link her name with
Antonio's.  Ever since she began coiling up her hair, it
had been taken for granted that her father would have
to go to Villa Branca or, at the very least, to Navares
in order to find a sufficiently important husband for
Margarida Clara Maria dos Santos Rebolla.  When,
however, the apothecary received an invoice from
Lisbon charging him half a pound for a single bottle of
champagne the maiden's fate was sealed.  The
inquisitive crowd who paid the apothecary three vintens
a head for a spoonful of the champagne were disgusted
with their bargain: but when the apothecary's
arithmetic was applied to Antonio's case they recovered
their spirits and unanimously made over Margarida
Clara Maria to the young Croesus of the valley who
was about to gild the parish with glory.
</p>

<p>
Margarida's parents were not surprised on learning
what the parish expected of them; for had they not
already brooded long and earnestly over the same plan?
Not to mention the Babylonian wickedness of Villa
Branca and Navares, town husbands were not acceptable
to the worthy couple, because town fortunes, town
incomes, town reputations, lay too much at the mercy
of the politicians.  Indeed, Senhor Jorge Maria dos
Santos Rebolla held politics in so much horror that he
would not seriously entertain the idea of Antonio as a
son-in-law until he had satisfied himself that the young
vintner was unpoisoned by factious doctrines.
</p>

<p>
Senhor Jorge made his inquiries in person.  On an
October afternoon, just after the heavier labors of the
vintage were ended, he called upon Antonio and asked
him to sign a petition for the replacement of a bridge
which had been swept away on the terrible night of
Antonio's fight with José.  The monk received his
visitor with honor and without suspicion.  He knew him
as an estimable lavrador, or large farmer: but he had
never heard of Margarida.  Outside his church-going,
Antonio had no dealings with the village.
</p>

<p>
When the monk had subscribed his name of da
Rocha to the petition, the lavrador thanked him and
rolled it up.
</p>

<p>
"Not that it will do any good," he added.  "In this
parish we've never learned to crawl up the sleeves of
politicians.  Ah!  When the last politician is dead,
Portugal will come to life again."
</p>

<p>
Antonio said nothing.  But Senhor Jorge did not
desist.  To catechise a stranger about his political
opinions was always a breach of good manners, and in
Portugal it was still dangerous.  Nevertheless the
lavrador continued:
</p>

<p>
"Senhor, everybody says you are a clever man.
You have been in England and France and Spain and,
some say, in Brazil.  You have seen many things.  I
am not a Miguelista; but I want to know if we are
any better off under the Liberals."
</p>

<p>
Antonio took time to think.  When he had decided
that there was nothing to lose by frankness he said:
</p>

<p>
"Your Worship is older than I, and far wiser.  But
here is my answer.  I, too, am no Miguelista.  If
Liberalism truly meant equal freedom and justice for
all, I should be a Liberal.  But Liberalism in Portugal
is only a name.  Your Worship speaks of England
and France.  I have traveled in those countries.  One
frosty morning, two hundred years ago, the English
cut off their King's head with a sharp axe in the name
of Liberty: but the Englishmen who did that deed
equaled the king before long in oppression and
intolerance.  Fifty years ago, in the name of Liberty, some
Frenchmen guillotined the King of France: but I have
seen a French river where, a few months afterwards,
the men who did that deed drowned barge-load after
barge-load of those who held other opinions.  Yes,
your Worship.  In a single town, in four months,
nearly ten thousand were shot or drowned&mdash;more than
the tyrant Miguel put to death in all Portugal, in all
his unhappy career."
</p>

<p>
"Then the Senhor does not believe in Republics?"
asked the lavrador.
</p>

<p>
"If all our citizens were good and wise and in
possession of the whole truth," answered Antonio, "a
Republic would be the best form of government.  But
the Portuguese are no more fit than the French for
such an experiment.  Nay, I will go further.  The
Portuguese are not ripe even for the English kind of
Parliament.  Our deputies are not the true choice of
the people.  They fill their pockets with the people's
money; and their empty quarrels poison the nation's
blood.  But I have said too much.  After all, what do I
know of politics?  I leave politics alone, and..."
</p>

<p>
He weighed his words.  When he uttered them,
they came softly and slowly.
</p>

<p>
"As for me," he said, "I hope to serve Portugal in
some better way."
</p>

<p>
The lavrador had not understood every word Antonio
said, but he felt sure he was on the right side.
He rose up with an approving nod and very modestly
asked if he might have a sight of his host's famous
vineyards and cellars.
</p>

<p>
Antonio, who was always willing to exhibit and
explain everything to any serious inquirer, rich or poor,
gladly consented.  He made it plain, as they walked
round the property, that he had introduced no novelties
for novelty's sake, and he was able to give a good
reason for every departure from local practice.
</p>

<p>
On the whole the lavrador was appreciative; but
the champagne worried him.  He would have preferred
to see Margarida Clara Maria in the care of a
husband whose wine-bottles stood on their heels and
not on their heads.  Still, inverted wine-bottles were
less detestable than topsy-turvy morals or politics.
Antonio seemed to be respectably but not excessively
religious; he was healthy; he was industrious; he was
unencumbered by relatives; and, best of all, he was
successful.  What more could be reasonably hoped for
in a son-in-law?  As Senhor Jorge said good-bye, he
wrung Antonio's hand with a bargain-sealing grip
which surprised the monk exceedingly.
</p>

<p>
The very next Sunday enabled Senhor Jorge and
Donna Perpetua, his consort, to open their campaign.
During the cura's sermon bursts of rain began lashing
at the south windows of the church, and it was raining
smartly when Mass came to an end.  José borrowed
a grass-waterproof: but, although the servant could
wear this peasant's garment, the master's dignity as a
landed proprietor forbade him to do likewise.  Senhor
Jorge seized his opportunity, and insisted that Antonio
should take shelter in his house, which stood less than
half a mile from the church.
</p>

<p>
Gossip nudged gossip and busybody winked at busybody
as the two men hastened off together.  But Antonio
saw neither the nudges nor the winks; and he
entered the lavrador's domain talking freely of
farming and of weather.
</p>

<p>
The buildings which met the monk's eyes were not
like a farm-house in England.  As in England, they
formed three sides of a quadrangle: but there the
resemblance ended.  The square yard was covered
nearly three feet deep with gorse-litter.  The buildings
to the right and left housed cattle, horses,
wine-presses, tools and stores of all kinds.  The principal
façade boasted two stories, the lower serving as a byre.
The upper story made some architectural pretension.
A broad flight of stone steps climbed up to it; and the
front door was set back in a three-arched loggia.
</p>

<p>
As Antonio mounted the steps he saw that blue and
white tiles lined the inside of the loggia and that the
stone floor had been newly whitened.  His host pushed
open the nail-studded door, and they entered a large
room lit by three windows in the further wall.  Many
doors and door-posts crowded the two side-walls; and
Antonio knew that these were the entrances to
bedrooms not much bigger than his own old cell at the
abbey.  There were a few pieces of strong old
furniture and some pots and crocks even more imposing
than José's: but there was no cheerful fire to dispel the
rawness and gloom of the stormy autumn day, and,
altogether, the place lacked comfort.
</p>

<p>
Donna Perpetua received Antonio with an attentive
cordiality greatly exceeding the utmost a mere
weather-bound churchgoer had a right to expect; but
the monk ascribed her warmth to old-fashioned habits
of hospitality.  One after another her three sons, Luiz,
Gaspar, and Affonso, strode into the room.  After
exchanging greetings with the visitor they sat down, side
by side, and did not utter a word.  Antonio turned to
them more than once with remarks or inquiries: but he
could get nothing in return save gasps, grins, and
flushes.  As Donna Perpetua and her husband were
not much more at their ease, the conversation soon
languished; and, when Antonio perceived that he was
doing all the talking, it ceased altogether.
</p>

<p>
Strangely enough, the whole family appeared to regard
the ensuing silence as a thing altogether natural
and seemly, like a silence in church.  When it had
lasted long enough, Donna Perpetua arose from her
chair in a curiously formal manner, and, going to one
of the side doors, called out, "Margarida!"  But the
monk, although he was vaguely conscious that the others
were preoccupied and constrained, still suspected
nothing.
</p>

<p>
The door opened, and Margarida Clara Maria dos
Santos Rebolla came forward into the meager light.
Antonia recognized her at once as a damsel he had
often seen kneeling on the church floor in the front
row of women.  So far as his thoughts had ever engaged
themselves with her, she had interested him by
her dark eyes and by the country bloom on her olive
skin.  He remembered how, that very morning, she
had pleasantly filled in the picture of rustic piety.
</p>

<p>
Antonio rose as she entered.  He saw that her head
was rather less attractive without the black lace
mantilla she always wore in church.  Her face was a little
too broad and her abundant hair was braided too
tightly.  But, to make up for the mantilla, Margarida
had adorned her person with unfamiliar splendors.
Of her fine lawn camisole only the snowy sleeves
could be seen.  The rest was hidden by an over-bodice
richly embroidered in many-colored wools.  Her
ample apron was even more magnificent than the
bodice.  Its bold stripes, triangles, circles, stars and
crosses stood out nearly a quarter of an inch from the
velvet ground in wools of blue, orange, vermilion and
green.  The full skirt, rather short, revealed a pair of
serviceable ankles.  Margarida's ribbed stockings were
white, and there was more embroidery on her velvet
slippers.  But the maiden's chief glory was her
jewelry.  Heart-shaped filigree ear-rings, of gold purer
than an English sovereign, hung from her ears.
These hearts were fully two inches long.  Her three
golden necklaces sustained two more filigree hearts,
each as long as her longest finger, and a solid gold
cross set with colored stones.  The greater part of her
belt was also built up from traceried squares and
circles of pure gold.
</p>

<p>
The monk feared that he had gazed too long and
curiously either at these gorgeous trappings or at their
wearer: for Margarida suddenly blushed crimson from
her topmost necklace to the roots of her black hair.
Donna Perpetua pronounced a formula of introduction;
but, overwhelmed by maidenly confusion, Margarida
said nothing in answer to Antonio's few words.
She fled to her mother's chair and huddled on a stool
beside her.
</p>

<p>
There was another silence.  But Antonio was
unperturbed.  Not only long years before, as a youth
in Portugal, but also during his journey with young
Crowberry, he had assisted at bourgeois and rich-peasant
functions equally tiresome.  Near Blaye, on
the Gironde, and again at a <i>tertulia</i> in Valladolid, he
had seen the men herding stupidly at one side of the
room while the women clung together at the other.  A
look through the window told him that the rain had
ceased; so he resolved to stay ten minutes more, for
decency's sake, and then to go home.
</p>

<p>
"Down in the valley we are less gay than this," he
said to Donna Perpetua, without intending to be
ironical.  "My man José and I are the only human beings
within two miles."
</p>

<p>
Donna Perpetua threw a glance at her husband, as
if to remind him of some pre-arrangement.
</p>

<p>
"If the Senhor is lonely," said the lavrador, "he
must come to our <i>serões</i>.  On Thursdays, at the full
moon.  That means next Thursday, about seven
o'clock.  He will do us a great honor."
</p>

<p>
"He will indeed," added Donna Perpetua.  "And if
he plays the mandolin let him bring it with him."
</p>

<p>
Antonio knew that at the serões, or soirees, of
Portuguese farm-folk there was much lore to be learned
which one might search for vainly in libraries.
Besides, it would hardly be neighborly to refuse an
invitation so heartily given and so kindly meant.
</p>

<p>
"All the honor," he said, "is on the other side.  I
will very gladly come."
</p>

<p>
Only at that moment did he discern the position.
Donna Perpetua's glance at Margarida lasted not much
longer than a flash of lightning; but, like a flash of
lightning, it revealed the truth to Antonio.  The
furtive looks of Margarida's brothers, both at their sister
and at one another, confirmed the revelation; and the
evident relief and satisfaction of Senhor Jorge
established it beyond a doubt.
</p>

<p>
Not without traces of hauteur in his manner and
curtness in his speech Antonio thanked his hosts for
their hospitality and took his leave.
</p>

<h3>
V
</h3>

<p>
The monk strode homewards with wrath in his heart.
At both their encounters Jorge dos Santos Rebolla had
deceived him by false pretenses.  Antonio now understood
that the petition for the new bridge was merely
an excuse for a spying visit to his little territory; and
the lavrador's solicitude for the dryness of Antonio's
skin was equally undisinterested.  He had been
trapped into a compromising position before all the
eyes in the parish, and he could hardly get out of it
without giving pain to the unoffending Margarida,
annoyance to himself, and an opportunity to the
gossip-mongers of the village.
</p>

<p>
Besides, the affair was a blow to Antonio's pride.
He had often recalled, with some complacency, his
skillful treatment of the young English beauty who
gave him the hot-house flower, as well as his tact
towards other great ladies who had failed to dissemble
their regard.  Yet here he was, enmeshed in the
first net which a pair of rustic match-makers had
troubled to spread.  Again, if a Francisco Manoel
Oliveira da Rocha were free to wed, it would not be
with a daughter of Senhor Jorge.
</p>

<p>
He swung down the muddy track slashing
murderously with his thin English walking-stick at the wet
brambles.  But Father Antonio had not ceased to be a
monk.  Every night he examined his conscience, and
nearly all day long, in his endeavor toward perfection,
he maintained a keen-eyed watch against the
approaches of sin.  So he reined in his bitter thoughts
with sudden strength, and set himself to analyze their
causes.  Experience had taught him how easily
un-Christian pride can be confused with righteous anger.
</p>

<p>
Before his trim white house rose into sight Antonio
re-entered the state of grace, and was once more in
love and charity with all his neighbors.  The results of
Senhor Jorge's proceedings were bound to be gravely
embarrassing; but his motives, after all, could not be
called disgraceful.  It was a father's duty to secure his
daughter's happiness; and Antonio could not deny that
Senhor Jorge's choice implied a certain compliment to
himself.  Again, the lavrador could not be blamed for
the devices he was using to press the business forward.
No one, save José, knew that a Benedictine monk was
living on the borders of the parish; and probably
Senhor Jorge thought he was doing a shy young bachelor
a service by taking charge of the courtship.
</p>

<p>
These charitable thoughts towards the people who
had drawn Antonio into a mess did not, however, help
him to get out of it.  The slight coldness and stiffness
of his farewells could hardly have been noticed by
Donna Perpetua and the family.  And on Thursday
they would expect him at their serão.  What was he
to do?
</p>

<p>
According to the cowardly and selfish rules of
worldly prudence, his only safe course was to sham
some illness or to invent some bogus call of business
which would enable him to evade the serão.  But such
ways were not Antonio's.  He had given his promise
and he meant to keep it.  Indeed, reflection convinced
him that the serão would give him his best opportunity
of putting an end to the affair.  Outside the church
Senhor Jorge had publicly compromised Antonio; at
the serão Antonio would publicly put himself right
again.  The parish should see that he was not a
woman-hater and a hermit: but the parish should see, also,
that he was not a marrying man.
</p>

<p>
About eight that night, as master and man were
returning from their usual Sunday evening exercises
in the abbey chapel, Antonio told José that he had
sheltered under Senhor Jorge's roof and that he had
promised to assist at one of his serões.  José tramped
along without replying: but it was plain he had a
comment to make.
</p>

<p>
"Is there something you want to say, José?" asked
Antonio.  "If so, why don't you say it?"
</p>

<p>
After stumping on another twenty paces in silence
José grunted:
</p>

<p>
"Senhor Jorge has a daughter."
</p>

<p>
"I know.  The Senhorita Margarida."
</p>

<p>
Although they were a third of a mile from home
José shut his mouth and did not open it again until
they were in the house, with the door shut.  Then he
spoke.
</p>

<p>
"I ask pardon of your Reverence," he began,
using the forbidden title with unconcealed
deliberation.  "Your Reverence is a holy monk.  He
understands Latin and French and English.  He
understands oranges and grapes, and winepresses and stills,
better than anybody else in Portugal.  But he doesn't
understand all the ways of the world&mdash;especially
young women."
</p>

<p>
"While you, José," retorted Antonio, "understand
all the ways of the world&mdash;especially young
women&mdash;perfectly."
</p>

<p>
"I don't, Father," protested José in alarm, "and
nobody else, either&mdash;may God help us all!  But I
understand a thing here and a thing there.  The truth is,
Father&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't call me Father.  The truth is what?"
</p>

<p>
"The truth is," replied José, in a mysterious whisper,
"they want to find a husband for the Senhorita
Margarida."
</p>

<p>
"Go on."
</p>

<p>
"Senhor Jorge wants to find some one rich&mdash;like
your Worship.  And Donna Perpetua wants to find a
born gentleman&mdash;like your Worship."
</p>

<p>
"Not to beat about the bush," Antonio interrupted,
"you mean that Senhor Jorge and Donna Perpetua
want ... me?"
</p>

<p>
José admitted it and began apologizing for his
presumptuous interference; but Antonio cut him short by
saying:
</p>

<p>
"You have done quite right to talk with me like this.
Thanks.  Never ask pardon for speaking plainly.
Now we will eat our bread."
</p>

<p>
It was the custom of the two men to dine on Sundays
before going up to the abbey, and to eat a small
broa, dipped in wine, on their return.  They sat down
to this simple supper, without any more words about
Margarida, and confined themselves to arranging the
farm-work for the morrow.  At half-past eight José
lit his lantern and went off to bed.
</p>

<p>
The monk made no haste to follow his example.
The room was chilly after the rain: so he kindled a
fire of cork-cuttings and walnut-shells.  It blazed up
lustily, and José's copper and pewter reflected the
cheerful light.  Antonio blew out the useless candle,
drew a chair up to the warmth, and sat down.
</p>

<p>
Outside, the stillness was profound.  José, no doubt,
had already fallen asleep.  No dog barked, no bird of
night cried.  Even the Atlantic lay hushed.
</p>

<p>
From the heart of this silent loneliness the spirit of
Antonio fared forth, craving the company of living
men.  He thought first of his old companions, the
fathers and brethren of his Order; of the Abbot, of the
Cellarer, of Sebastian, of Cypriano.  But it was little
more than an hour since he had walked past the doors
of their abandoned cells and had sat in the midst of
their empty stalls; and, try as he might, he could only
think of them as impalpable ghosts hovering over the
dim and deserted abbey.  Then he tried to think of
Crowberry, of the young Queen Victoria's nonchalant
Comptroller, of the clean-shaven, wiry, iron-willed
Duke.  But England seemed ever so far away, on the
other side of a thousand miles of rain and darkness;
and only one memory stood up warm and clear.  It
was the memory of that summer evening, when the
vane on the gray church tower burned like a flame and
when the blue smoke from the cottage hearths and the
children's merry cries had suddenly turned the exile
sick with yearning for love and home.
</p>

<p>
Yes.  Although all other English memories were
faint, that one scene rebuilt itself before his mind's
eyes, solid, richly colored, vocal.  He saw once more
the cattle knee-deep in clear, purling waters beside the
steep old bridge, and he heard the rooks cawing.  It
was so like a happening of yesterday that he remembered
even the chaff of Mr. Crowberry about his Portuguese
sweetheart, Teresa or Dolores or Luiza, or
Carmen or Maria.
</p>

<p>
Maria.  Margarida was named Maria.  Margarida
Clara Maria.  The syllables resounded in his brain
like tinkling cymbals.  They revived that morning's
experiences in the lavrador's house with so full an
actuality that Antonio's mind-painting of the golden
English village faded into gray and brown.  Margarida.
When Donna Perpetua called out her name she
had stepped forth; and now, once more, as Antonio
breathed it, she seemed to be advancing through the
lonesome byways of his heart.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the Rebollas were discussing him at that
very moment.  He tried to imagine Senhor Jorge
holding forth to his trio of inarticulate sons.  But he
failed.  The picture which his imagination persisted
in painting was a picture of Donna Perpetua talking
to Margarida.
</p>

<p>
Donna Perpetua, like Senhor Jorge and the three
dumb dogs of sons, was doubtless a worthy creature.
But the picture looked better without her.  Again, the
comfortless living-room of the lavrador made an
unamiable background.  Antonio's fire of cork-bark and
nut-shells had sunk from a blaze to a glow, and the
bright eyes of the polished copper vessels no longer
winked and peeped down upon his privacy.  But the
unwonted warmth, after the long walk in the fresh air
and his draught of generous wine, made him drowsy.
His will was no longer supreme.  And so it came to
pass that a soft dream-shape stole in upon him and sat
down on the other side of the hearth.  Margarida.
</p>

<p>
Her presence seemed good to Antonio.  Her voice,
her cheeks, her arms, her movements were soft and
gentle.  She had great, mild, stupid, kind eyes, like
the eyes of the contented English kine beside the steep
stone bridge.  Margarida was brainless: but her
brainlessness rested his own brains, weary with plans and
fears.  Sitting beside her, without speaking, brought
healing to his fretted spirit.  Margarida did not
challenge the soul to high romantic passion.  She sat there
not like a proud maiden to be wooed and won through
stress and storm but more like a comely, cosy, docile,
loving young matron.  Antonio, ever drowsier and
drowsier, surrendered himself more and more
completely to unheroic peace.  He had battled for long
years in the teeth of bitter winds and icy currents: but
at last he yielded himself up to the deliciousness of
drifting down a summer stream, warmed by the sun
and hardly ruffled by scented zephyrs.
</p>

<p>
Margarida seemed to have come nearer.  She was at
the further end of the hearth no longer, but was sitting
on one of José's carved coffers at his side.  All the
room felt soft and silken.  As Antonio's drowsy eyes
closed, his right arm sought Margarida's waist that
he might gently draw her to his breast....
</p>

<p>
He awoke in an instant and started up with a cry.
For two or three moments his wits went on sleeping,
and he could not say if he breathed in heaven or on
earth or in hell.  The fire had almost died out, and he
would have been standing in complete darkness if two
dull, red eyes had not stared at him from the hearth.
Antonio pressed agonizing hands against his throbbing
temples and moaned a broken prayer.
</p>

<p>
As he came to himself the door was flung open and
José rushed in with a lantern.  He had heard the cry.
</p>

<p>
"It is nothing," said Antonio.  "I fell asleep in my
chair, and I had ... I had a kind of nightmare."
</p>

<p>
"It's these new-fangled French wines of your
Worship's," José grumbled.  "Give me honest green wine,
old-fashioned Portuguese.  It drowns your nightmares
before they are born."
</p>

<h3>
VI
</h3>

<p>
Antonio kept his promise and took part in the
Thursday serão at the farm of Senhor Jorge.
</p>

<p>
The monk's robust common-sense would not suffer
him to be tormented by false scruples.  On the
preceding Monday, when he accomplished his daily duty
of self-examination, he had not failed to recall his
Sunday night's surrender to the dream-maiden: but a
well-instructed conscience acquitted him of blame.
Antonio knew how to distinguish between the deliberate
thoughts or imaginations of his waking moments
and the unbidden guests of his dreams.  Under the
saintly Abbot he had studied perfection in a manly
school where morbid super-sensitiveness could not
exist an hour: and he was too keenly alive to his real
faults to accuse himself of fanciful sins.  His drowsy,
involuntary pleasure in the shadowy Margarida's
presence was not sin; it was only homesickness.  All the
same he did not wish the vision to return: and
therefore he began to lay a new emphasis on the lines
<i>Procul recedant somnia, Et noctium phantasmata</i>, when he
recited the Compline hymn.
</p>

<p>
Having first ascertained that local usage permitted
him to do so, Antonio took José with him to the serão.
The servant wore his Sunday clothes; the master his
second-best.  Both of them were glad that they had
spent some pains and time on their appearance; for
they were joined, half-way, by a fellow-guest in all the
glory of feast-day raiment.  In the bright moonlight
they recognized this sumptuous personage as one
Emilio Domingos Carneiro, the eldest son of a small
farmer.  Although he was on foot, he was appareled
for proud feats of horsemanship.  Bright spurs stood
out from his tall jack-boots, and he wore a horseman's
jacket of black cloth, felted.  His fine white shirt
was fastened by silver buttons, and a light red sash
topped his tight breeches.  To make up for the steed
which he did not possess, Emilio carried a business-like
whip.
</p>

<p>
At a cross-road the party picked up Emilio's two
cousins, Joaquina and Candida Carneiro.  These
strapping damsels wore green cloth skirts, large green
silk kerchiefs with the ends drawn cross-wise over
their camisoles, and aprons of many colors.  Their
hats were enormous.  If the brims had not been
caught up to the pork-pie crowns by means of blue and
yellow cords, they would have measured three feet in
diameter.
</p>

<p>
As Antonio neared the threshing-floor where the
serão was to be held, he noticed with satisfaction that
not many of the guests had arrayed themselves after
the fashion of the resplendent Carneiros.  Most of
those present had come to work as well as to play, and
they were dressed accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Donna Perpetua and her husband welcomed Antonio
with proprietary airs.  Towards José they were
sufficiently gracious, and Donna Perpetua expressed her
pleasure at the sight of the speechless fellow's
mandolin.  Luiz and his brothers were already hard at play
on the threshing-floor; but of Margarida nothing was
to be seen.  Perhaps, thought Antonio, she was sitting
among the group of young men and women who were
husking maize on the sheltered side of the threshing-floor.
</p>

<p>
The night was warm and balmy.  From the south-west
a few clouds had begun to rise: but the round
moon was riding free, high among the sparkling stars.
A tinkling of guitars and the chattering and light
laughter of youths and maidens rippled the surface of
the enormous silence.  The scene was almost as bright
as day.  Here a girl's gold ear-ring, there a man's
buckles or buttons of old silver, caught and flung back
the faerie light.  Some of the older women were
spinning.  Eight-pointed wooden wheels whirred round,
buzzing like bees.  A youth as handsome as a god
lolled on a log, carving an ox-yoke.  Where the
maidens sat all together, the colors were like peacocks'
tails and rainbows; and it was there that the moonlight
lingered wantonly on plump arms and little ivory
hands.
</p>

<p>
A clapping of palms proclaimed the end of the game,
and Luiz made haste to begin another.  He and
Affonso climbed up two poplars, one on the north side
of the threshing-floor, the other on the south; and to
these trees they tied the two ends of a thin rope, so
as to stretch it at a height of eight or nine feet from
the ground.  Before making his end fast, Luiz passed
it through the handle of a coarse brown jug.  Descending
to the ground, he picked up a six-foot clothes-prop,
made from the dried stalk of a giant cabbage,
and with this he shoved the jug along the rope until
it dangled absurdly over the center of the floor.  Then
he produced a clean white handkerchief and sang out
for the first player.
</p>

<p>
The youth who had been carving the ox-yoke
dropped his work and leaped into the ring like a Greek
athlete into the arena.  Everybody clapped hands
again.  The handkerchief was bound over his eyes
and the light pole was placed in his hand.  Luiz turned
him three-quarters round; clutched his arm and walked
him half-a-dozen paces this way and that; and then,
retreating to the edge of the floor, began to count a
hundred, loudly and quickly.
</p>

<p>
The handsome youth, with self-confidence apparent
in every limb and muscle, stepped back, swung the
pole around his head, and smashed mightily at the
point where he thought the jug was hanging.  Empty
air received the blow, and a burst of laughter mocked
him.  Luiz went on counting, and many of the older
people counted with him, aloud.  At forty the youth
struck again; but he was all at sea, and he was marching
further away from the line.  At seventy, eighty-five,
ninety he slashed thrice more; and at a hundred
he dragged off his bandage to find that he had walked
nearly off the threshing-floor on the further side.
Amidst applause, he came back, smiling pleasantly,
and resumed his carving of the yoke.
</p>

<p>
Emilio was the next to try.  This was his great
game, and the four blows he struck were all within a
yard of the jug.  Once he missed it by less than a
hand's breadth.  But Emilio was not in luck, and he
uncovered his eyes a little sulkily, only recovering his
good spirits when six or seven players in succession
failed more signally than himself.
</p>

<p>
At last José put himself forward.  Never having
seen the sport before, he had been loud in ridicule of
Emilio and the other pole-wielders.  His career was
short and inglorious.  He cut fiercely at nothing
before Luiz could count five.  Then, losing his head, he
advanced rapidly towards the bevy of young women,
brandishing his weapon and laying about him right
and left.  The girls sprang up screaming and took to
flight.  At thirty-seven José's feet struck a heap of
maize-leaves and he came down tremendously, full
length among the cobs.  This was the kind of climax
to delight the rural mind; and the night was rent by
shouts and shrieks of laughter.
</p>

<p>
Unhappily José was not a good loser.  He struggled
to his feet with that wild tigerish rage in his
eyes which Antonio had seen before; and if his master
had not sprung to the rescue and murmured words
in his ear there would have been trouble.
</p>

<p>
"It's nothing," said Antonio.  "It's only a game.
Stay here, where you are.  And give me the
handkerchief.  I'll try myself.  Watch me while I make a
bigger fool of myself than all the rest of you put together."
</p>

<p>
The girls came flocking back as Antonio, advancing
to a spot exactly under the jug, submitted to the
bandaging of his eyes.  He became conscious, at once, of
a different mood in the spectators.  Nearly all the
gabbling ceased.  Everybody was gazing curiously at the
mysterious Senhor Francisco Manoel Oliveira da
Rocha, the man who had trod the golden streets of
London, the man who caused bottles of wine to be
worth three milreis each by standing them upon their
heads, and, above all, the man who was going to marry
Margarida dos Santos Rebolla.
</p>

<p>
The counting began.  To the blindfolded man it had
an uncanny sound; for nine-tenths of the onlookers
were chanting the numbers with Luiz in a subdued,
expectant sing-song.  But he kept his senses about
him.  During the few moments while Luiz was
turning him round and pushing him about, Antonio had
bent his whole mind to the business of smashing the
jug.  Not that he expected or even wished to smash it.
On the contrary, he had come forward determined to
fail.  But it was part of his nature to do with all his
wits and might whatever he took in hand.
</p>

<p>
Luiz bawled out twenty before Antonio made his
first stroke.  He did not touch the jug; but neither
did he thwack the vacant air, for he distinctly felt the
rebound of the pole's tip from the rope.  He moved a
pace to the right and struck again; but the pole
encountered nothing.  Meanwhile he knew that he had
come near to victory, because the sing-song of the
spectators had suddenly grown sharper and more
excited.  He went back half a step and swept the space
above him with a curving stroke as Luiz reached sixty-three.
</p>

<p>
So uproarious a shout arose that Antonio did not
hear the jug break, and he thought for a half a second
that, in fulfilment of his prophecy to poor José, he had
made himself the supreme fool of the evening.  But,
a twinkling later, the broken pieces crashed loudly at
his feet, and, in the same moment, he knew that the
intolerable counting had ceased.  Somebody rushed
forward to loosen the bandage; and, as it fell from
his eyes, he saw Margarida standing with a beaming
face among the young women.
</p>

<p>
Before he could greet her, a general stampede
whirled Margarida out of sight.  The younger guests
were rushing to take up positions for a new sport in
which all could join.  Emilio explained to Antonio
that it was to be a game of rounders, played with a
clay pot instead of a ball.  This little pot, such as
could be bought any fair-day for a vintem, had no
handle.  It was of red clay, baked thin and brittle.
The players stood round in an extended circle.
</p>

<p>
Donna Perpetua, as the hostess, led off by throwing
the pot to Emilio; but, as soon as he had caught it,
she resumed her place among the matrons.  Emilio,
after taking aim fixedly at Joaquina Carneiro, who was
close at hand on his right, turned suddenly on his heel
and tossed the clay to Rosalina Saldanha, a graceful
blonde who was far away on his left.  These ruses and
pretenses were the salt of the game.  The bowl flew
spinning through the air in less than two seconds: but
Rosalina was on the alert, and she caught it with her
two slender hands amidst applause.
</p>

<p>
Clouds from the south-west were mounting higher,
but the moon still shone brilliantly.  Under the trees
a lazy guitarist went on strumming his thin, moonlight
music, as crisp as hoar-frost and tinkling like
icicles.  Whenever the pot was flung high, fifty bright
eyes saw, up above it, the planets and the stars; but the
players were too young and too happy to moralize.  In
their unstudied attitudes they made up a picture full
of rhythmic grace.
</p>

<p>
Four times the pot hurtled its way to José; and four
times he caught it before it touched the ground.  At
the fourth catch, he turned it like lightning to Emilio;
and Emilio spun it slowly and gracefully into the hands
of Margarida.
</p>

<p>
Margarida paused, clasping the red clay in fingers
which were less slender than Rosalina Saldanha's, but
whiter.  Every eye was fixed upon her.  She knew
that she ought to toss the bowl to one of her brothers,
or to a young woman, or to one of the older men.
But an irresistible impulse moved her another way;
and, with glowing cheeks and radiant eyes, she sent
it curving across the space which separated her from
Antonio.
</p>

<p>
Had it dashed like a stone from the catapult-hand
of José or flashed like a meteor from the palm of
Emilio the monk could have caught the pot.  But
Margarida's action took him unawares.  What was
he to do?  When the pot was in his hand, how was he
to treat her public act of favor?  If he should&mdash;
</p>

<p>
His thinking was over in a flash; but it was too late.
He plunged at the pot clumsily and missed his catch.
The pot struck the hard floor and broke into a hundred
pieces.
</p>

<p>
As a rule the smashing of the pot was the signal for
a burst of mocking merriment.  But instead of a
light-hearted uproar there was an awe-struck silence.
Everybody seemed to recoil from a sinister omen.
Two more pots stood on a log, in readiness for the
second and third rounds of the game; but no one
stirred a step to fetch them.  Antonio's gaze
involuntarily followed the general movement and rested on
the face of Margarida.  The glow was gone from her
cheeks, the light from her eyes.  Very pale, she turned
away.
</p>

<p>
A weak gust of wind rattled two or three dead
leaves across the threshing-floor and a few cold drops
fell from the darkening sky.
</p>

<p>
"The lamps are lighted in the barn," cried the voice
of Senhor Jorge.  "Come in, all of you, before the
rain."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0307"></a></p>

<h3>
VII
</h3>

<p>
Senhor Jorge's lamps were not as bright as full
moons.  Their smoky flames lit up the vast barn so
feebly that candles had to be set at the elbows of the
knitters and stitchers and spinners.  The spattering
of the rain against the dusty windows made a
dreariful sound.
</p>

<p>
There were games that could be played in a barn
every bit as gay as the games of the open air.  But
the merry-makers had lost their good spirits, and
nobody gave a lead towards recovering them.  One by
one the maids and youths sat down on full sacks or
empty barrels, or squatted on the ground.  When all
were seated Donna Perpetua very politely begged José
to tune his mandolin and to sing a fado, or love-song.
</p>

<p>
For the sake of the young people, Antonio felt glad.
More than once he had heard José singing folk-songs
which would have brought smiles to the faces of the
most austere; and he took it for granted that José
would break out with one of these rollicking lays.
José, however, succumbed to the surrounding
depression.  Having tuned his mandolin, which was
unusually large and sonorous, he began playing a doleful
prelude.
</p>

<p>
Had his mind been free to enjoy it, Antonio would
have found the music brimful of charm.  The
descending minor scale was occasionally, but not
always, used in ascending passages, and the monk
could not doubt that José had received some tradition
of tonality which urban ears would have rejected with
ignorant scorn.  As José played on, it seemed that he
changed the scale more often than the key.  At last
he subsided into a more familiar gamut and began to
sing in slow and mournful tones:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O! fountain weeping softly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou canst not weep for ever:<br>
  But the full fountains of my tears<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be congealed never.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O! weep, my eyes, and weep, my heart,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bereaved and forsaken;<br>
  Weep as the holy Virgin wept<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night her Son was taken.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Alas! the sadness of my life.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! my life of sadness;<br>
  Would I had wings to fly with thee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Swallow, Bird of Gladness!<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O Eagle! flying up so high,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon thy strong wings fleet me;<br>
  O Eagle! lift me to that sky<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where she prepares to greet me."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
José ceased singing, but went on playing.  Although
a printed page of music meant no more than so many
black lines and dots and rings to his untutored mind,
he was a musician to his finger-tips, and he could
expound to others in tones many an emotion which he
could not express even to himself in words.  Unlike
most Portuguese performers, whose melodic phrases
were short-winded and very conventionally joined
together, he was capable of trailing out long-drawn
melodies and of welding them into forms of his own.
José's huge fingers stroked the strings so subtly that
the monk could almost see the eagle urging up, up, up,
above the purple serras, above the moon and stars,
until it swept on unwearied wings through the gates
into the City.
</p>

<p>
But Antonio could not give himself up to watching
the great bird's flight.  He was painfully conscious
that he and his man were killing the serão.  In
breaking the bowl he had almost broken poor Margarida's
heart; and here was José driving everybody down into
the depths of the blues.  He glanced apologetically
towards Donna Perpetua: but the candle on the trestle-table
beside her lit up the unshed tears in her gray eyes
so weirdly that he hastened to gaze upon the ground.
</p>

<p>
José's threnody ended at last, and he stumped back
to his place without the slightest acknowledgment of
the listeners' chastened applause.  From a corner one
of the guitarists struck up a lively dance-tune; but
his notes sounded so thin after José's that he broke off
of his own accord.  To save the situation, Antonio
plunged in desperately and asked if Donna Perpetua
knew any riddles.
</p>

<p>
Yes.  Donna Perpetua knew several.
</p>

<p>
"Who is it," she asked, "that knows the hour but
not the month; that wears spurs but never rides a-horse;
that has a saw but isn't a carpenter; that carries
a pick-axe but isn't a quarryman; that delves in the
ground but gains no wages?"
</p>

<p>
Antonio could not guess: but his ignorance was
covered up by a general shout of "The cock!"
</p>

<p>
"Good," cooed Donna Perpetua.  "Now explain
this: 'Before the father is born the son is climbing
up to the roof.'"
</p>

<p>
"Smoke!" roared everybody.
</p>

<p>
"What is born on the mountain," she continued,
"and comes to sing in the house?"
</p>

<p>
The shrill voices of the old women were loudest in
the chorus of "A spindle!"
</p>

<p>
"And who is it who is born on a dunghill, yet comes
to eat with the king at his table?"
</p>

<p>
"A fly!" was the immediate unanimous answer.
</p>

<p>
Donna Perpetua beamed benevolently upon the company.
It had pleased her to be made prominent.  The
guests were equally pleased: for had they not shown
the brightness of their wits, or, at the very least, of
their memories?  Antonio was entertained in a different
way.  These cut-and-dried riddles and answers
reminded him of a village school which he had visited in
England and of the joyous heartiness with which the
rosy-cheeked boys and girls, in answer to the teacher's
question, "What is hell?" roared out, "It is a bottomless
and horrible pit, full of fire."
</p>

<p>
By way of returning the compliment, Donna Perpetua
invited Antonio to propound one or two of the
riddles he had heard in England.  Unguardedly he
gave consent: and only when he began racking his
memory did he perceive his mistake.  He had heard a
feeble riddle in a country house about a door being
a jar; but the pun could not be made in Portuguese.
Again, he knew by heart a rhymed enigma, said to be
Byron's, on the letter H; but this was worse still.
Apart from the Portuguese having no aspirate, how
could he render the line "'Twas whispered in heaven,
'twas muttered in hell" into a language which spelled
heaven with a "c" and hell with an "i"?  At last he
cut short a very uncomfortable silence by saying that
the only English conundrums he knew could not be
translated.  At this remark the girls hung their heads
modestly and the matrons gave silent thanks that they
had not been born in an apostate country where the
very riddles brimmed with blasphemies and lewdnesses.
</p>

<p>
"England is no good," grunted Emilio, who had
been playing a tune on his jack-boots with the handle
of his whip.  "The English have plenty of money;
but they live dogs' lives.  In England there are no
fruits, no flowers.  They have no wine save what we
send them from Portugal.  When the rain stops, there
is a fog.  No Englishman ever sees the sun."
</p>

<p>
"Things are hardly so bad as that," said Antonio,
smiling.  "In July and August I have known the sun
in England shine as fiercely as any sun in Portugal.
It is true there are no grapes or oranges, except those
that grow in glass hot-houses; but the English have
apples and pears, cherries and strawberries, plums and
damsons, as fine as ours.  Their flowers are wonderful;
and I wish everybody in Portugal could see an
English village."
</p>

<p>
Emilio, whose father had suffered wrongs under
Marshal Beresford during the Regency, thwacked his
boot again with the whip-stock and mumbled.
Antonio was concerned.  He and José had already gone
far towards wrecking the serão, and he saw the
necessity of avoiding a quarrel.  So he added what he
conscientiously believed, saying, in a conciliatory tone:
</p>

<p>
"The English are not the equals of the Portuguese.
But they are a fine people and a great nation."
</p>

<p>
"I have heard," put in Senhor Jorge, "that the
English are not happy."
</p>

<p>
"They were merry once," Antonio answered, "and
they will be merry once more when they regain the
Faith."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Donna Perpetua devoutly.  "Only
those who are going to be happy in the next life can be
truly happy in this."
</p>

<p>
"Yet the English ought to be happy," objected
Senhor Jorge, growing restive at all this piety.  "They
have the best government in the world."
</p>

<p>
"Even the best government in the world is very
bad," Antonio retorted.  "Still, with all its faults, the
English government is indeed the best in Europe.
There is much more intrigue and corruption in their
public life than they care to recognize; but one can get
justice in their courts, and, except for Catholics, there
is almost complete liberty.  If we Portuguese had a
government one half so good&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
A thin, short, bald, bent old man with a long white
beard and madly bright eyes leaped out of the shadow
and startled Antonio by shouting:
</p>

<p>
"Till he comes back there'll be no good government
in Portugal.  They'll go on being thieves and
cowards.  Yes, thieves.  The French were thieves
and bullies.  The English were thieves and bullies too.
Dom Miguel was the worst thief and coward of them
all.  As for the Queen&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Antonio staunched the flow of eloquence before
treason could burst forth.
</p>

<p>
"Whom do you speak of?" he demanded quickly.
"You say 'Till he comes back.'  Who?"
</p>

<p>
While the old man stood glaring at the monk with
trembling lips, Senhor Jorge bent over and whispered
in Antonio's ear:
</p>

<p>
"Have patience with him, your Worship.  He is a
Sebastianista&mdash;the only Sebastianista for leagues
around.  On all other points he is saner than I am.
He is a good man.  I beg your Worship to indulge
him."
</p>

<p>
Antonio did more than indulge the hoary monomaniac.
He strained forward, all ears.  That there
should be a Sebastianista left alive in Portugal amazed
him.  From the lips of a very old Jesuit he had once
heard of some Sebastianistas in the forests of Brazil,
and the Abbot had mentioned a Sebastianista whom
he had seen, as a child, in the Açores.  But a
Sebastianista was the last curiosity Antonio had expected to
meet at Senhor Jorge's serão.
</p>

<p>
"Tell us all about it," he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, your Excellency," moaned the old man, "I am
a poor blacksmith and no scholar, and I cannot use
fine words."
</p>

<p>
"Don't some people believe," asked Antonio, egging
him on, "that King Sebastião was killed by the Moors
at the battle of al-Kasr al-Kebir?  Don't they say his
body rests in the church of the Jeronymos at Belem?"
</p>

<p>
"Lies, all lies!" cried the Sebastianista.  "Why
were we beaten at Alcacer-Kibir by those hounds of
infidels?  Because they were braver or stronger?
No.  It was because we had sinned and the just God
punished us.  But I tell your Excellency that not one
hair of the King's head fell to the ground.  He
departed unhurt from the battle.  The tomb in the
Jeronymos is emptier than this barrel."
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately the barrel which the Sebastianista
kicked with the iron tip of his wooden shoe gave back
a blunt sound which proved that it was full.  The
girls began to titter; but the old man raved on,
unabashed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he cried, "King Sebastião, the brave, the
good, the Desired, escaped without a scratch on his
body, although he had fought a hundred Moors
hand-to-hand.  He slew eighty with his own sword.  He is
waiting in the enchanted isle.  Waiting, waiting,
waiting.  God knows things are bad enough in
Portugal.  But they will be worse.  And when they are
worst of all, he will come back.  The Hidden Prince
will come back, riding on a white horse.  He will
drive out the thieves and cowards.  He will deal out
justice to rich and poor alike.  He will set up the Fifth
Empire."
</p>

<p>
"The Fifth Empire?" echoed Antonio, astonished
at hearing such a phrase from such lips.  "What is
the Fifth Empire?"
</p>

<p>
"It is the Empire which King Sebastião will set
up," said the old man.
</p>

<p>
"But, come now, Senhor Joaquim," objected Emilio
pertly.  "Isn't it rather a long time since King
Sebastião went away?  Tell us.  How long ago?"
</p>

<p>
"It was before my grandfather was born," snapped
the old man, wheeling defiantly towards Emilio.
</p>

<p>
"Then when he comes back he'll be thrice as old
as you are.  He'll have no hair, no teeth, and he'll be
as blind as a bat.  So how much good will he be?"
</p>

<p>
"How much good will the King be?" bellowed the
Sebastianista.  "How much good?  Senhor Emilio
Domingos Carneiro, I'll tell you.  If he's an old man,
thank God for that!  Portugal has suffered enough
from the young ones.  And hark to this: He'll be a
true old Portuguese.  He'll be a man, not a dandy.
He won't crack whips and wear spurs unless he can
mount a horse without falling off on the other side."
</p>

<p>
At this home-thrust most of the young men
chuckled or laughed outright, while the girls giggled.
Donna Perpetua, however, was flurried and Emilio's
cousins tried to protest.  With ready tact Senhor
Jorge preserved the peace.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Joaquim," he said.  "Talking has made you
thirsty.  Come with me and I'll find you a mug of
good wine to drink King Sebastião's health in."
</p>

<p>
The old man, proud at having had the best of it,
departed nimbly in his host's wake and was no more
heard or seen.
</p>

<p>
"Does the Senhor believe that Dom Sebastião will
ever return?" asked the handsome yoke-carver,
turning to Antonio.
</p>

<p>
"I've just been reckoning," the monk answered,
"that it is more than two hundred and sixty years
since the day of the battle."
</p>

<p>
Two hundred and sixty meant little to the handsome
youth, who had never had occasion to engage his
brains with any such number.  He knew that he
possessed ten fingers and ten toes, and that there were
seven days in the week and that his father owned eight
bullocks; but who had ever heard of such a number as
two hundred and sixty?  He stared at Antonio
blankly.
</p>

<p>
"It seems to me," put in José, "that when we see
Dom Sebastião on a white horse, it will be his ghost."
</p>

<p>
He uttered the word "ghost" in a tone which made
the pretty Rosalina Saldanha clasp her pretty hands
and emit a pretty squeak.  The other damsels
squeaked after her, in chorus.  They reveled in
ghost-tales, although they dreaded them.
</p>

<p>
Antonio laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Your Worship may laugh," railed Emilio, who
seemed determined to shine in one way or another.
"But he wouldn't laugh if he saw what some people
have seen."
</p>

<p>
The girls cuddled together in delicious fright.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps your Worship has not heard," continued
the dandy, feeling important, "about the lobis-homem
of Rio Briga, between Santarem and Thomar?"
</p>

<p>
Antonio had not heard of this particular case.  But
he was familiar with the lobis-homem or were-wolf
superstition in general, and he detested it as a
poisonous survival from dark and cruel days.  He knew
that, in remote mountain hamlets, this lingering pagan
lie sometimes brought life-long anguish to the very
unfortunates who most needed help and love.
Involuntarily the monk's eyes sought Donna Perpetua's.
He saw that she wished as little as he did to hear of
were-wolves.
</p>

<p>
"Are not all tales of lobis-homens alike?" said
Antonio to Emilio.  "Will not your Worship tell us
another tale instead?  I have heard that a Moorish
maiden was once turned to stone up in these hills."
</p>

<p>
"It's a tale for little girls," snorted Emilio.
Horror suited his narrative style better than romance.
But he tried to recite the legend of a young peasant
who heard one of the stones of the fountain cry out
piteously.  He went on to tell how the peasant
released the Moor-maiden from the spell and married
her; how she wrought him grief; and how her
evil-spirit was cast out by a hermit.  But Emilio's touch
was heavy; and, as every one present knew the story
by heart already, he bored his audience badly.
</p>

<p>
"Your Excellency lives almost by himself," said a
pleasant, middle-aged woman, pausing in her spinning
and looking towards Antonio, "so it is important
he should be on his guard against the cock's egg."
</p>

<p>
Antonio looked bewildered.
</p>

<p>
"Once every seven years," she explained, "the cock
lays a tiny egg, as round as a marble and as black as
ink.  It is smaller than a pigeon's.  As a rule the rats
get it and no harm is done.  But, if your Excellency
has no rats, take care.  If the egg is not destroyed a
monster will come out of it.  Perhaps you won't see
him; but, wherever he is hatched, he causes the death
of the master of the house within the year."
</p>

<p>
She resumed her spinning.  Antonio thanked her
politely and promised that he would show no mercy
to any egg as black as ink and as round as a marble
which he might find about his farm.
</p>

<p>
"You can't be always sure you've found the egg,"
said the woman, pausing again.  "So it's a good
thing always to leave a pair of scissors open on a shelf,
especially at night."
</p>

<p>
Antonio perceived that the open scissors made the
sign of the Cross; and it thrilled him to find, in this
peasant-woman's chatter about eggs and scissors, a
miniature picture of the millennial struggle between
heathenism and Christianity.  For he had common-sense
enough to understand that, while she held the
Christian Faith with all her heart and mind, she was
only half-serious about her grandsires' goblins and demons.
</p>

<p>
"Are open scissors good against anything else
besides monsters out of black eggs?" asked José.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered the spinner.  "They're good
against witches."
</p>

<p>
"I was hoping they might be good against ghosts,"
grumbled José.
</p>

<p>
Antonio was surprised.  José was still only
half-educated; but he had never before found him
superstitious.  As for the more serious guests, they were
scandalized.  The farrier's wife, Donna Catharina de
Barros Lopes, who was a "Blessed One," said aloud:
</p>

<p>
"Thanks be to God there are no witches left!  As
for ghosts, there never were any."
</p>

<p>
"Then the Senhora has never been up to the old
abbey chapel on a dark night?" asked José doggedly.
</p>

<p>
Antonio could not believe his ears.  As for the
other guests, they sat up and bent forward, all sudden
excitement.  There were no more affected little
squeaks from the maidens.  All, even the men, were
struck dumb at the news that a ghost walked within a
league of Senhor Jorge's barn.  Emilio Carneiro,
whose farm was only a mile and a half from one of
the abbey gates, turned white with terror.
</p>

<p>
"No," answered the Blessed One curtly.  "I do not
go, Senhor, up to the old abbey chapel on dark nights.
And what is more, I don't intend to."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad to hear it," said José, with maddening
slowness.  "The Senhora is better at home.  And the
rest of your Worships too."
</p>

<p>
When the general excitement could no longer be
suppressed, Senhor Jorge, who had just re-entered the
room, demanded sternly:
</p>

<p>
"What is all this?  Why are we better at home?"
</p>

<p>
"Because," said José in awe-struck tones, "it's very
easy for us to talk and be brave here, in the light and
in good company.  But I don't think we should stay
up there very long if we saw&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If we saw&mdash;?" urged six or seven voices.
</p>

<p>
"If we saw a monk, all in black, sitting in his stall,
with a face as white as a curd cheese."
</p>

<p>
Rosalina Saldanha screamed and collapsed into the
stout arms of Joanna Quintella.  Twenty people
began talking at once, and bombarding José with
questions.
</p>

<p>
"No," cried Antonio loudly.  "No more.  We've
had more than enough of witchcraft and ghosts and
superstition.  Donna Perpetua&mdash;Senhor Jorge&mdash;I ask
pardon for interfering."
</p>

<p>
"Your Worship is quite right," answered Senhor
Jorge, with warmth.  "In my own house such talk is
forbidden.  We don't want the maids in hysterics.
Luiz&mdash;Affonso&mdash;every one is dying of thirst and
hunger.  Where are the broas?"
</p>

<p>
The two young men, whose limbs were brisker than
their tongues, jumped up and began filling roughly
glazed and gaily painted jugs and mugs with green
wine from a newly broached cask.  Senhor Jorge was
famous for his hospitality, and even José's ghost was
forgotten for a moment in the good-tempered
rough-and-tumble.
</p>

<p>
Margarida, who had remained invisible since the
breaking of the bowl, now reappeared.  She and her
brother Gaspar each carried a basket of broas.  These
were not the plain work-a-day broas; they looked
paler, because of an admixture of fine flour, and they
were sweetened with honey and flavored with spice.
Gaspar began distributing his dainties at the far ends
of the barn, while Margarida served the notables round
the candles.
</p>

<p>
Antonio could not unlearn in a single moment his
old habits; and therefore, when he took his broa from
Margarida's hand, he thanked her with the softly
strong tones and the momentary boldness of the eyes
which, without his knowing or intending it, had
captivated more than one high lady in England.  If
Donna Perpetua or the farrier's wife or the spinner
had offered the broa, he would have expressed his
thanks in the same way.  But poor Margarida found
in his voice and glance a lover-like reverence, meant
for herself alone.  She forgot the evil omen of the
broken bowl, and hurried away with rosy fires burning
on her cheeks and love-lights dancing in her eyes.

<h3>
VIII
</h3>

<p>
When the serão was beginning to break up, Senhor
Jorge asked Antonio into the house in order that he
might judge some old wine.  After it had been tasted
and praised, the lavrador gazed at the monk wistfully
and said:
</p>

<p>
"I hope the Senhor is not superstitious?"
</p>

<p>
"Superstitious?  I hope not," Antonio replied.
"And I promise, Senhor Jorge, that I will speak very
plainly to my man José about that ridiculous ghost-story."
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't thinking of your man José," said the
lavrador.  And, after an awkward pause, he added:
"That clay pot.  Your Worship failed to catch it.
And just after the pot broke the sky was darkened.
It ... it upset my Margarida very much."
</p>

<p>
Antonio's heart sank.  Had Senhor Jorge been
merely a selfish match-maker, bent on marrying off
Margarida for his own profit, it would have been easy
to rebuff him by silent contempt.  But the monk knew
that he was face to face with an honest Portuguese of
the old school who was sacrificing pride to duty.
</p>

<p>
To gain time Antonio poured another spoonful of
wine into the thin English glass.  Having warmed it
with his hand, he swirled it round, sniffed it, and held
it up to the lamp.  But he did not drink it.  Replacing
it on the table, he said:
</p>

<p>
"Have two or three minutes' patience with me, Senhor
Jorge, while I perform one of the hardest tasks of
a life which has not been easy.  For three years I
have lived like a hermit.  To-night is my first social
recreation since I settled down in this parish."
</p>

<p>
"Go on," urged Senhor Jorge.  His face was paler
and his mouth twitched.
</p>

<p>
"My farm was a tangled wilderness.  Our work
claimed all our time.  Now and again business took
me to Navares or Villa Branca; but I hardly knew
the names of half-a-dozen people in this village.  Your
Worship, I will come to the point.  When you called
at my farm I did not know you had a daughter.  I
had seen the Senhorita Margarida in church; but until
her mother called her into our presence last Sunday
I did not know she was yours."
</p>

<p>
"You know now," muttered the lavrador angrily.
"And I'd like to hear what's wrong with her.  If any
one has breathed a whisper against her I'll kill him
with my own hands.  Yes!" he cried, raising his
voice, "I'll do it as easily as I'd cut a pig's throat."
</p>

<p>
"Not so fast," said Antonio.  "I have not heard
one word against Margarida.  And I can use my
eyes.  I know she's as good as gold."
</p>

<p>
"Then what's wrong?  Out with it!  Isn't she
pretty enough for your Worship?  Most people call
her a beauty.  Or are you afraid she won't have
enough money?"
</p>

<p>
"Her beauty is so great that it would be wasted in
an out-of-the-way corner like my farm," said the
monk, keeping his temper.  "As for money, it's the
last thing in the world I should think of.  But the
truth is, I do not mean to marry."
</p>

<p>
After he had stared at Antonio a full minute, the
lavrador's stern face suddenly relaxed and he burst
into unaffected laughter.
</p>

<p>
"If that's all, friend Francisco," he chuckled,
clapping Antonio on the back, "it's less than nothing.
Why, I myself didn't mean to marry: and look at me
to-day!  De Barros Lopes, the farrier, swore he'd
never marry; and he has eight children.  Old Martins
said he would hang himself before he would marry;
and this is his third wife."
</p>

<p>
"Then old Martins has taken my share," said
Antonio curtly.  "I repeat I shall not marry."
</p>

<p>
"The reason?"
</p>

<p>
"My ... my work."
</p>

<p>
"Work?  Is your Worship the only man in Portugal
who works?  There's a bit of work, now and
again, on my own farm.  Is it the worse done because
there's a mistress, and three stout sons and the best
daughter a man ever had?  Work!  My wife and I
squabble sometimes; but the best day's work I ever
did was to get married."
</p>

<p>
The monk held his peace.  Senhor Jorge, genuinely
desirous of promoting Antonio's happiness as well as
Margarida's, chaffed him with rough heartiness.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come," said he.  "Your head's full of cobwebs.
You've been hiding yourself too long in holes
and corners.  Don't be a fool.  It's all very well
while you're young and healthy; but, when days and
nights of sickness come, who will nurse you then, and
put up with your foibles?  And who will carry on the
wine-making when you're dead and gone?  Come,
you don't want to let the grand old family of Da
Rocha die out?  Besides ... a man without a
woman is only half a man."
</p>

<p>
Senhor Jorge uttered his concluding sentence with a
meaning change of tone.  But, even if his own daughter
Margarida had not been involved, the lavrador had
too much delicacy to expand this clinching argument.
Antonio, however, scented the meaning.
</p>

<p>
What was he to say?  All these arguments against
celibacy, and a host of others more refined, had
hurled themselves in his teeth a dozen years before,
when he first contemplated the vow of chastity.  But
the answers which satisfied him were not available in
the presence of Senhor Jorge.  He could not reply
that he had deliberately renounced his high-sounding
names until events forced him to resume them; that he
welcomed roughness and solitary vigils of pain in
thankful honor of the Man of Sorrows; and that the
succession of Saint Benedict's spiritual family was
secure until the end of the world.  With bent head and
knitted brows he remained mute.
</p>

<p>
"Then I will persuade you no more," said Senhor
Jorge.  "If my wife knew I had said half so much,
she would never forgive me.  By Saint Braz!  To
think I should be begging and praying anybody to be so
kind as to marry Marge!  Before I asked for
Perpetua, I had to go down almost on my bended knees.
Pssh!  Sometimes, before she braided up her hair,
I've watched Margaridinha playing about the house
and I've thought how I would hum and haw and
hesitate when a suitor should come along.  I thank your
Worship.  For to-night I've done with him.  If he
wants to speak to me after Mass next Sunday he may;
but next Sunday will be his last chance."
</p>

<p>
Antonio flung himself against the door before his
ruffled host could open it.
</p>

<p>
"One moment," he pleaded in low, insistent tones.
"Here and now let me say, once for all, that neither
next Sunday nor any other day can I do myself this
great honor.  Senhor Jorge, I shall never forget the
extreme compliment you have paid me.  Senhor, I
trust you to keep my secret.  I cannot ask for
Margarida because ... already ... I am..."
</p>

<p>
"You are married already," hissed the lavrador,
blazing into terrible indignation.
</p>

<p>
"No.  No, no, a thousand times.  But ... I
am plighted to another Bride."
</p>

<p>
He turned away abruptly and walked to the tiny
window.  The scudding moon had escaped from the
black rain-clouds, and Antonio thought he could
discern the white belfry of the abbey chapel rising above
the distant pine-woods.
</p>

<p>
"Another bride?" echoed Senhor Jorge, more
wrathful than ever.  "Who?  Where?  When?
It's that chalk-faced chit of a Rosalina Saldanha!"
</p>

<p>
"No," Antonio answered, wheeling round.
"Neither Rosalina Saldanha nor any other mortal
woman you've ever seen or heard of."
</p>

<p>
"Then where is she?  Why does she leave you year
after year alone?  Tut!  A fine bride.  Let her
take you or leave you.  You're a fool to stand it."
</p>

<p>
"We will not quarrel," said the monk.  "If you
knew all, you would not malign Her.  It may be years,
many years more, that I must live alone.  But my
faith is plighted, and there's an end."
</p>

<p>
This time it was the older man who walked to the
window.  After a long time he asked, without looking
round:
</p>

<p>
"Why did not your Worship think of this before?
Why did he come here to-night, leading on my poor
Marge, and setting all the tongues a-wagging?"
</p>

<p>
There was an obvious and fair retort; but Antonio
did not make it.  Instead, he answered:
</p>

<p>
"For that blunder I ask pardon.  I had promised to
come to the serão: and I had some foolish idea that
it would give me a chance of putting matters right.
In England I prided myself on having tact in these
things.  But pride goes before a fall.  Forgive me for
not staying away.  I have blundered worse than a
village booby.  Yet I hope, in spite of all, that we may
part friends."
</p>

<p>
They parted friends.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Out in the open, Antonio said to José:
</p>

<p>
"Hear me for one minute on a matter we need never
mention again.  I have made it plain to Senhor Jorge
that I am not free to marry the Senhorita Margarida."
</p>

<p>
"But Senhor Jorge was not satisfied with that?"
</p>

<p>
"I told him," replied Antonio awkwardly, "that I
am already plighted to another Bride.  You know
what Bride I mean, José?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  But Senhor Jorge doesn't."
</p>

<p>
Half a mile further on Antonio demanded:
</p>

<p>
"About this ghost&mdash;this black monk in the chapel.
I was thunderstruck.  I thought you were mad."
</p>

<p>
"For once in my life," said the peasant, "I had all
my wits about me.  I overheard that cockatoo of an
Emilio saying that he often took a stroll in the abbey
gardens, after his day's work.  He was lying; but I
didn't want the other young fellows to begin prowling
about up there."
</p>

<p>
"They'll prowl all the more now."
</p>

<p>
"They never will, your Worship," affirmed José
flatly.  "They're the poorest lot I ever saw.  There
isn't a man among them.  Why, at Pedrinha das
Areias, if we had heard of a ghost, a dozen of us
would have turned out to see how ghosts looked after
they have been soused with buckets of cold water.
Here they're fops and cowards.  No, your Worship.
From to-night the abbey is safe."
</p>

<p>
Antonio marveled at José's shrewdness.  It was of a
piece with his shrewdness in choosing the sun-baked
sand-pit for burying the boxes of the Viscount.  All
the same he felt it his duty, as José's spiritual director,
to rebuke him mildly, saying:
</p>

<p>
"But there's no ghost there at all."
</p>

<p>
Hardly were the words out of his mouth before he
regretted them.  Fresh from his well-meaning
prevarication with Senhor Jorge, who was he to censure
others?  He hoped José would not notice the
inconsistency; but he hoped in vain.
</p>

<p>
"I never said there was any ghost," chuckled José.
"I said there was a monk, all in black, in his stall.
You know what monk I mean, your Worship."
</p>

<p>
"But Emilio Carneiro doesn't," said Antonio.
</p>

<p>
They laughed loudly together and strode on,
talking with unwonted gaiety under the bright moon.
Had not the master rid himself of match-makers, and
had not the man made the abbey safer than ever?
</p>

<p>
"Sing," begged the monk.
</p>

<p>
The peasant struck up a rousing song in praise of
wine.  But in the middle of the third verse he
stopped.  They were crossing the road which led from
Navares to the main gate of the abbey.  José sank on
one knee and pored over something he had seen.
</p>

<p>
Two wheels had cut two deep grooves in the wet
sand.  José measured the distance between them with
his two palms.  Then he examined the marks of the
horse's shoes.
</p>

<p>
"These wheels," he said, "were not Portuguese.
And, unless they've shod him in Lisbon or Oporto,
these shoes didn't belong to a Portuguese horse."
</p>

<p>
Antonio hardly heard him.  High on the hill, from
inside the principal window of the abbey guest-house,
the flame of a candle looked out like a living thing.
</p>

<h2>
BOOK IV
<br><br>
THE AZULEJOS
</h2>

<p><br><br></p>

<h3>
I
</h3>

<p>
Until one o'clock in the morning Antonio and José
sat in council.  But their session was barren.
</p>

<p>
Who was up at the guest-house?  Could it be the
Viscount de Ponte Quebrada, resuming his search for
the buried pictures and chalices?  They thought not.
The Viscount had become a considerable personage,
and could not afford to run such risks.  Or was it the
Viscount's old accomplice, the Captain?  Perhaps.
The Captain had little to lose.  But no: it could not be
he.  A thief would never have proclaimed his presence
by setting lights in front windows.
</p>

<p>
For a minute or two Antonio indulged a hope that
the visitor was merely his old adversary, the official of
the Fazenda at Villa Branca.  But José shook his
head, and said that such a guess was too good to be
true.  He went on to avow a presentiment that the
abbey had been sold.  Antonio could not contradict
him, and the two men sat silent for a long time.
</p>

<p>
"Come and speak to me at dawn," said the monk,
going at last to the hearthside and lighting José's
lantern.  "Perhaps it will be best for one of us to march
up boldly to the guest-house.  As the nearest neighbors
we can easily make some excuse."
</p>

<p>
José shook his head again and departed without a
word.
</p>

<p>
Soon after daybreak they met in the garden, and
the master confessed that his man was right.  God
only knew what high strategy and petty tactics they
might have to employ in their defense of His house;
and it would be the worst policy to thrust themselves
into notice.
</p>

<p>
The autumn sun was rising behind the abbey hill.
Pearly mists hid everything.  But, as the glorious orb
ascended, the tides of vapor began to ebb.  Here and
there the tops of the higher pines showed themselves
above the drifting mists, like masts and shrouds of
ships wrecked in milky shallows.  A minute later the
chapel and the monastery buildings appeared, huge
and vague as an enchanter's palace suddenly exhaled
from twilight seas of foam.
</p>

<p>
As the outlines sharpened, Antonio recalled his
vigil on the moonlit night of his return.  He
remembered the fear which preceded it&mdash;the sickening fear
that he might be too late.  But he remembered also
how he had finally trusted in God to guard His own.
</p>

<p>
"Come, José," he said.  "You have done your share
and I have tried to do mine.  Our Lord will do His.
It is time for prayers."
</p>

<p>
He led the way to the narrow room which served
them as oratory, and drew back a curtain from a
picture of Our Lady of Perpetual Succor.  José's
education had advanced so far that he was able to recite
Terce in Latin.  They sat down facing one another,
on benches which José had carved like stalls, and
began the Hour.  At the psalm <i>Levavi oculos</i>, peace
and strength entered their souls.
</p>

<p>
"I have lifted up my eyes unto the hills, from
whence my help shall come," said Antonio.
</p>

<p>
"My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and
earth," responded José slowly and attentively.
</p>

<p>
Their faith waxed stronger as the psalm proceeded.
"Behold, He that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber
nor sleep," said José; and Antonio answered: "The
Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy defense upon thy
right hand."  José said: "The sun shall not burn thee
by day, nor the moon by night."  Antonio said: "The
Lord keepeth thee from all evil."  José said: "May
the Lord keep thy coming in and thy going out, from
this time forth and for ever."  And by way of Amen,
Antonio put his whole soul into the appointed <i>Gloria
Patri</i>, and into the first words of the following psalm
<i>Laetatus sum</i>, "I was glad."
</p>

<p>
They parted at the oratory door, and consumed
separately their first breakfast, which consisted of rye
bread and of a so-called coffee made from roasted
grain and the roots of dandelion.  Before six José
was at work removing gorgeously discolored leaves
from a pergola, while Antonio planted some vines
which had come to him from Sexard in Hungary.  As
they moved about they could plainly see the buildings
and out-buildings of the abbey; for the mists had
drifted away.  But no smoke rose from the guest-house
chimney, and the place gave no sign of life.
</p>

<p>
At half-past ten, when José was in the kitchen
preparing almoco, or second breakfast, Antonio heard a
dull muttering of hoofs on the sandy road.  He dropped
his tools and began running like a hare up the
ravine, so as to get a view of the horseman from
behind a boulder.  Ducking his head and shoulders he
kept himself out of sight.
</p>

<p>
The noise of the horse's feet stopped.  Antonio was
startled.  He raised his head and saw a mounted man
stooping from the saddle, and fumbling with the latch
of the farm gate.  While he remained in this position
it was impossible to make out his age, or class, or
nationality.  The monk, however, did not wait.  He
turned and raced back to warn José.  But, before he
could reach the kitchen door, the horseman came
cantering down the slope.
</p>

<p>
He sat his bay horse rather stiffly and in an
un-Portuguese style.  His clothes looked English.  As he
drew near, Antonio saw that he was young and blonde.
The monk had a feeling that he and this stranger had
met before.
</p>

<p>
It was young Crowberry.
</p>

<p>
When he recognized Antonio a flash of joy lit up the
youth's pale blue eyes.  But, instead of greeting his
old cicerone simply and straightforwardly, he jumped
down from his horse and began to declaim some
prepared rigmarole.
</p>

<p>
"Zounds!  By'r Lady!" he cried, "whom have we
here?  Marry, by my halidom, I trow it is the goodly
knight Oliveira da Rocha himself."
</p>

<p>
"Why not speak English?" asked Antonio, wringing
the young man's hand.
</p>

<p>
"English?" he retorted.  "If you're disrespectful,
Senhor da Rocha, I'll begin speaking Portuguese."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Pode</i>," said the monk.  Which meant "he may."
</p>

<p>
Young Crowberry fumbled in his pockets and fished
up a manuscript phrase-book which had been compiled
for him, he pretended, by some pitiful friend in
Oporto.  After turning the pages this way and that,
he asked:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Está prompto o almoço?</i>"  Young Crowberry
meant "Is breakfast ready?"
</p>

<p>
"Not quite," said Antonio.
</p>

<p>
"<i>O que tem Fossa Mercê</i>: What has your
Worship got?"
</p>

<p>
"Brown bread, green figs, white cheese, purple
grapes, red wine, and black coffee."
</p>

<p>
"<i>De-me alguma bebida</i>: Give me something to drink."
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand," said Antonio, shaking his head.
</p>

<p>
José, hearing voices, thrust his shaggy face through
the window and glared at young Crowberry, with his
mouth almost as wide open as his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"This," said Antonio, "is José Ribeiro, the <i>régisseur</i>
of the Château da Rocha.  He knows more about
sea-sand wine than any other man north of Collares."  And,
turning to José, he explained in Portuguese:
"You have heard me speak of the English Senhor
Crowberry.  This is his son.  Go and kill a
chicken&mdash;the fat brown one."
</p>

<p>
When José had departed on his murderous errand,
Antonio brought their guest a large glass of green
wine.  Young Crowberry drank it with a wry face;
but he admitted that it acted like a charm in quenching
his thirst.  They walked out into the vineyards.
</p>

<p>
"And now, Senhor Eduardo, explain yourself,"
demanded the monk.
</p>

<p>
"I came on ahead&mdash;last night," said Senhor Eduardo.
</p>

<p>
"Ahead of whom?"
</p>

<p>
"Of the others."
</p>

<p>
By this time Antonio was getting irritated by young
Crowberry's tiresome smartness; and he was on the
point of asking him, rather sharply, not to be a young
ass.  But he restrained himself and waited.  At last
young Crowberry said:
</p>

<p>
"They are in Coimbra.  Dirty hole.  They're
following next week.  I came on ahead to chase out the
rats and beetles."
</p>

<p>
"We saw a light last night in the guest-house
window," said Antonio.  "Do you mean to tell me you
opened the place in the dark, and slept there by
yourself?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  What of it?"
</p>

<p>
"Simply this.  My dear Eduardo, you are not half
such a muff as you try to look, and not one tenth such
a ne'er-do-well.  But about these 'others.'  Who are
they?  Why are they coming here?  How long will
they stay?"
</p>

<p>
"Firstly," replied Edward Crowberry, "there's the
guv'nor.  Secondly and thirdly, there's Sir Percy and
his daughter.  Fourthly, there's Mrs. Baxter.  Fifthly
and sixthly and all-the-restly, there's the servants."
</p>

<p>
"Who are Sir Percy and his daughter?  And who
is Mrs. Baxter?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir Percy is Sir Percival Lannion Kaye-Templeman.
His daughter is named Isabel.  Lady Kaye-Templeman
died before I was born.  That's why
there's a Mrs. Baxter.  She's called Isabel's
governess; but it's Isabel who does the governing."
</p>

<p>
"Why are they coming here?"
</p>

<p>
"The devil only knows.  I'm sure they don't."
</p>

<p>
Antonio stopped dead.
</p>

<p>
"Master Edward," he said, "if you're wanting to
be a wit or a rattle you shall practice on me at
breakfast.  But not now; not here.  Why are these English
people coming here with your father?"
</p>

<p>
"What's the use of asking me?" demanded young
Crowberry, somewhat injured.  "It's a complicated
business, and I haven't brains enough to puzzle it
out."
</p>

<p>
"Then use such brains as you've got.  Have they
bought the abbey, or taken it on lease, or what?"
</p>

<p>
"Something of that sort," pouted the young man.
"The guv'nor will explain.  I tell you I don't
understand it."
</p>

<p>
A jangling bell announced that breakfast was ready.
Young Crowberry threw up his hat and shouted for
joy.
</p>

<p>
José's fat brown chicken did not remind the guest
of a Surrey capon.  But as his teeth were good and his
appetite still better, he devoured two-thirds of it with
relish, and had still enough hunger left for the fruit
and bread and cheese.  During the meal he consumed
a whole bottle of wine and, to finish off, he drank a
large cup of corn-and-dandelion coffee, as well as two
little glasses of Antonio's orange brandy.  Then he
lit one of his own cigars.  Antonio excused himself
from smoking.
</p>

<p>
Soothed and warmed by these good things, young
Crowberry gradually became a reasonable human
being.  He began to talk naturally, and the monk was
rejoiced to see that he was vastly improved.  It turned
out that he had gone back home after only eight
months in Oporto, and that he had thrown up the
wine-trade in favor of civil engineering.  He told Antonio
about the railway mania in England, and nearly all his
talk was of cuttings, viaducts, and tunnels.  Only
with difficulty was he led back to the abbey.
</p>

<p>
"All I know is this," he said at last.  "You wrote to
the pater about raising a thousand or two and buying
the place yourself, didn't you?  Well, the old man'd
have done it like a shot, only he was putting his last
shilling into the Sheffield and Birmingham Railway.
I expect he'll lose it all in the long run.  But he
wanted to find you the money.  So he's made some
kind of a bargain with Sir Percy.  They've been
jabbering and scribbling over it for a year.  Sir
Percy's supposed to have bought the abbey from the
Portuguese Government.  Don't ask me how he's
managed it.  I always thought he was so hard up he
couldn't buy a penny bun."
</p>

<p>
The monk's heart beat fast.
</p>

<p>
"But if this Sir Percy has bought it," he asked,
trying to conceal his intense anxiety, "what good is it
to me?"
</p>

<p>
"Any amount," said young Crowberry.  "You
don't want a lot of tumbling-down cells and chapels
and cloisters; you only want vineyards.  As for Sir
Percy, he does not want to be bothered with vineyards;
he only wants a nice place.  So you're to be offered
a perpetual lease of the vines.  No, not perpetual.
Only nine hundred and ninety-nine years.  So don't
waste any time."
</p>

<p>
The room, with its odors of food and wine and
tobacco, suddenly seemed to stifle Antonio.  He felt
faint and sick.  Under the coarse tablecloth his two
hands were so tightly clenched that the nails cut his
flesh.
</p>

<p>
At first he blamed his own stark folly in writing to
Mr. Crowberry.  But he quickly remembered how
long had been his deliberation and how many his
prayers before writing the letter.  Indeed, he had not
posted it until, as he believed, the voice of the Holy
Ghost said "Yea."  For a few moments Satan entered
into the monk's heart.  So this was God's way of
keeping faith with His champions!  Seven years,
seven hungry, lonely, loveless years of unceasing toil
... and for what?  For this: that the holy house
of God and the venerated home of Antonio and his
brethren should become "a nice place" for the
spendthrift heretic.
</p>

<p>
Into the ears of the monk's soul the arch-tempter
breathed his poison.  "If you had known last night,
under the moon, what you know this morning," he
whispered, "you would not have let Margaridinha's
bowl smash into atoms.  Poor Margaridinha!  First
you broke the bowl, and now you are breaking her
heart.  She has sobbed all night, for your sake.  But it
is not too late.  Go back to Senhor Jorge.  Say to
him&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Antonio sprang up and strode to the open door.
</p>

<p>
"The devil," said young Crowberry.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  The devil!" cried Antonio, turning upon
him with a terrible look.
</p>

<p>
But the promise of Terce was suddenly fulfilled:
<i>Dominus custodit te ab omni malo</i>.  Without the
smallest anti-devilish volition on Antonio's part,
without one <i>Retro me, Satana</i>, without one syllable of
prayer, without one crossing of his breast, the tempter
vanished back like a spent flash of lightning into the
dark.  Nor did he flee leaving behind him a void.  It
seemed that in his unholy footprints stood a strong
angel of consolation.  Antonio's faith returned with
three-fold force.  Once more he knew that God would
do His part, and that these new happenings were parts
of His design.  Perhaps He was about to draw
Antonio and José along mysterious ways.  Perhaps it
was His will that they must press with torn raiment
and bleeding feet through many a thorn-brake and
over leagues of sharp-edged, burning stones.  But it
was to victory and triumph, not to defeat and shame
that the path ran.
</p>

<p>
When the monk, with inarticulate apologies, resumed
his place at the table, the terrible look in his
eyes had given place to radiant happiness.
</p>

<p>
"That's right," said young Crowberry.  "I was getting
frightened.  I was beginning to remember a story
I read years and years and years ago, when I was
only a young fellow, like yourself.  It was something
about a man falling down dead, because somebody had
broken good news to him too suddenly."
</p>

<p><a id="chap0402"></a></p>

<h3>
II
</h3>

<p>
Before young Crowberry set out on his return to
Coimbra, he deigned to say a little more about his
movements and his party.  It appeared that he could
speak Portuguese fairly well, and that he had traveled
all the way from Oporto to the abbey in an English-built
dogcart drawn by an English-bred horse.  After
depositing his heavier luggage in a bedroom at the
guest-house and spending one night there, he had left
the dogcart in the stables, and was returning on
horseback, with nothing but saddle-bags, a heavy-handled
whip, and a pistol.
</p>

<p>
The monk asked twice for some account of Sir
Percy Kaye-Templeman.  His first application drew
forth the answer that there were many better fellows;
his second that there were many worse.  Concerning
Sir Percy's daughter, young Crowberry was voluble:
but very little information could be extracted from his
discourse, which was almost entirely to the effect that
young Crowberry would give his hat (or, at successive
repetitions, his ears, or his horse, or tuppence, or the
whole world, or his boots, or his soul, or his dinner,
or a million pounds) to know what Senhor da Rocha
thought of her.
</p>

<p>
It was of Mrs. Baxter that the young man spoke
with most clearness.  He persisted in never naming
her without the prefix "That Excellent Creature."
</p>

<p>
"That Excellent Creature, Mrs. Baxter," he said,
"gave me solemn instructions to see that large fires
were kept blazing in all the bedrooms for a whole day.
Now, except in the kitchen, there isn't a single fireplace
or chimney.  So I smoked all over the place instead."
</p>

<p>
Antonio did not suffer his visitor to depart without
a message to Mr. Crowberry, senior.  He sent word
that he sought the honor of providing a simple dinner
for Mr. Crowberry and his friends on the day of their
arrival.  With regret he added a request that each one
of the party would bring his own napkin, knife, fork,
and spoon.  He concluded by offering his friendly and
neighborly services in general.
</p>

<p>
José agreed to walk a couple of leagues at the bay
horse's side, so as to show young Crowberry a
bridle-path which would save him three hours in the saddle.
They left at one o'clock.
</p>

<p>
As soon as horse and men were out of sight,
Antonio hurried up the hill and made his way into the
abbey.  It was his hope and prayer that Sir Percival
would be restrained by lack of cash from interfering
with the monastery and that he would live quietly and
cheaply in the more modern and airy little guest-house.
But the monk knew that the sacred pile was menaced
by a thousand perils; and therefore he spent nearly an
hour in wandering from kitchen to refectory, from
library to calefactory, from cell to cell, from cloister
to chapel.  Perhaps he was near the last time.  With
burning earnestness he recited Vespers in his old
stall.
</p>

<p>
Rising from his knees, Antonio paid a visit to a
useless-looking door in the outer wall of the cloisters.
Like all the other doors of the building, it was so well
plastered over with official seals on the outer side that
José and Antonio had never dared to use it.  Yet
Antonio knew its secret well.  A massy bolt appeared
to secure it, like the gate of a castle; but there was a
tiny green-painted stud of iron hidden in the masonry
outside which controlled the whole.  By pressing the
stud, the staple on the door-jamb moved slightly,
leaving the bolt free.  This clever and simple
mechanism was due to an English Benedictine, who had fled
to Portugal just after the martyrdom of the Abbot of
Reading, under Henry the Eighth.  Antonio
examined it, and found it in good order.
</p>

<p>
He and José reached home almost at the same
moment.  The man would have returned to his work
without a word had not the master stopped him.
</p>

<p>
"These English people, who are arriving next
week," said Antonio, "may become, in the long run,
our worst enemies.  But they think they are our
friends.  They mean well.  We will do our whole
duty to them as neighbors."
</p>

<p>
José said nothing.
</p>

<p>
"It is my prayer," added Antonio, "that they will
lock up the monastery and be satisfied with the
guest-house.  For some things, I wish ... I hope
... I should like them to hear ... I mean,
José, I should like some one in the village to tell young
Mr. Crowberry your ghost-tale about the monk."
</p>

<p>
"He knows it already, your Worship," said José
stolidly.
</p>

<p>
"Knows it already?  Who told him?"
</p>

<p>
"I did, your Worship."
</p>

<p>
Antonio could have wrung José's hand.  But the
shaggy fellow had a little more to tell.
</p>

<p>
"They come on Tuesday," he said slowly.  "The
young Senhor Crôbri says he is going to sit up in the
chapel on Wednesday night.  But he won't see
anything; because I know that next Wednesday the monk
won't be there.  The young Senhor is going back to
England, starting on Thursday.  After that, the monk
can do as he likes.  The senhoras will be so frightened
at the young Senhor's tale that they won't go near the
abbey.  As it's nearly winter, perhaps they'll soon be
afraid of the guest-house too.  Ghosts might begin
appearing up there, as well, before long.  You never
know."
</p>

<p>
"Come," said Antonio, after he had done marveling.
"We are both tired.  We had a late night and
an early morning, and we've walked a long way.
The young Senhor ate both wings of the brown
chicken and all the breast.  But there are the two
legs left.  And, for once, we will open a bottle of our
good wine."
</p>

<p>
On the Sunday afternoon, at an earlier hour than
usual, José and Antonio went up to the abbey.  They
oiled the secret levers which controlled the bolt in the
cloisters, and replaced on the shelves of the library
a few pious books which they had borrowed.  Afterwards,
sitting in opposite stalls of the choir, they sang
Vespers and Compline.  It was safe to sing, for once;
because the feast of Saint Iria had drawn the whole
able-bodied population of the parish to the village of
Santa Iria do Rio, nearly three leagues away.  In
hushed voices they sang all the psalms to the proper
tones; also the two hymns and the Magnificat.  The
sun shone warmly through the western window while
they were singing: but the chapel was growing dim
when they arose at the end of their silent prayers.
</p>

<p>
On the Monday little was done outside elaborate
preparations for the morrow's dinner.  Nearly all
José's heirlooms rose again from their carven
sarcophagi.  His six solid silver spoons, his solid silver
ladle, and his china bowl with dark green leaves on a
light green ground cried aloud for a worthy soup; and
accordingly much time had to be spent in preparing
a cream of cauliflowers.  Meanwhile, a fowl, two
partridges, and the prime parts of a kidling were
gently cooking in a giant casserole, along with four or
five handsful of vegetables and herbs.
</p>

<p>
On the Tuesday, between eleven and twelve, when
Antonio was upstairs shaking out his fine suit of
English clothes, an ill-blown coach-horn blared out a
wanton greeting.  The monk leaped to his tiny
window.  An imposing procession was jolting along the
narrow road.  Antonio's keen eyes could make out
almost everything, although the road was over a
furlong away.
</p>

<p>
At the head of the file rode young Crowberry on his
bay.  With one hand he was holding a short horn to
his mouth, while with the other he bunched up the
reins and strove to caracole his deeply scandalized
steed.  Next rolled an open chariot, containing two
quietly dressed ladies and Mr. Crowberry, <i>père</i>.  This
was followed by a hired carriage, of Portuguese build,
wherein sat a tall, straight, military-looking
Englishman and the official of the Fazenda, from Villa
Branca.  A smaller hired carriage held one of the
Fazenda clerks and a Villa Branca notary.  Two
closed coaches, looking like superannuated diligences,
brought up the rear.  Antonio guessed that these
crazy and stuffy vehicles were carrying the
Englishman's servants and personal luggage.
</p>

<p>
The procession crawled up a slope, and disappeared
in the dip of the hills.  But five minutes later, while
he was cutting an armful of flowers for the dinner-table,
the monk saw it mount again on its way to the
abbey.  About noon he distinctly heard, through the
still air, the big gate screaming on its rusty hinges.
It reminded him of the exceeding bitter cry with which
that same gate had cried out when Saint Benedict's
sons went forth from their ancient seat.
</p>

<p>
Antonio could picture the successive scenes.  He
could almost see Mrs. Baxter, young Crowberry's
Excellent Creature, throwing up horrified hands at the
comfortlessness of the guest-house, although Father
Sebastian had been wont to grieve over its almost
sinful luxury.  He could imagine the Fazenda dignitary
pompously breaking the seals, and calling upon all to
witness the close of his impeccable stewardship.  He
could almost hear young Crowberry quipping and
quirking about everything.  But this last thought was
too much for Antonio.  It suddenly sharpened, almost
to a poignant certainty, his fear lest irreverent feet
should profane the holy place, and lest sacrilegious
hands should be laid upon the Ark of the Lord.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Crowberry and the others were to arrive at
half-past three and to dine at four, so that they could
regain the guest-house before dusk.  It was therefore
with dismay, that Antonio heard horses and wheels
on the road just as José's clock was striking three.
He sprang up the stairs two at a time, and changed his
clothes with both haste and speed.  When, however,
he descended to the ground-floor, it was not
Mr. Crowberry's voice which met his ears.
</p>

<p>
The monk's visitors were the Villa Branca notary
and the official of the Fazenda.  They had left their
carriage and the clerk waiting on the road.  The
notary said little: but the great man from the
Fazenda was fulsomely wordy.  Up at the abbey
Mr. Crowberry had more than confirmed in his hearing
nearly all the local rumors concerning Antonio's
cleverness and prosperity, and he deemed it prudent to pay
so considerable a personage his respects.
</p>

<p>
There was coldness in the monk's tone as he prayed
his old scorner to be seated; for he could not forget
that, after his ten-league journey to Villa Branca, he
himself had been kept standing.  But, as policy
required that he should stand well with the henchman of
the Government, he concealed most of his disgust.
To think of this pilfering bully sitting familiarly at
his table went against Antonio's grain; but, when he
found that both the notary and the official had heard
of the impending dinner, he went so far as to suggest
that they should remain.  Happily, however, the
shortness of the days made it necessary that the pair
should at once resume their long journey.  They
drained two cups of wine, flourished a few parting
compliments, and hurried away.
</p>

<p>
Hardly could the monk give a rapid glance at the
table and a final order to José before young
Crowberry was upon him, plunging from one room to
another and back again, like a dog just off the leash.
He poked his nose into everything, and kept on
rattling out a thousand criticisms and witticisms.
</p>

<p>
"Mind you count these, later on," he chattered, as
he weighed two silver spoons in his two hands.  "If
you find one missing, go through the pockets of that
Excellent Creature, Mrs. Baxter.  What's this?
That beastly green wine?  Pour it down the sink.
And, look here, I say, mind you, da Rocha: don't
forget to remember what I said about Isabel Kaye-Templeman.
Where did you get this cloth?  By the way,
Sir Percy isn't such a bad old sort, after all.  Have
you got any more of that orange brandy?  I'll have
mine in this."
</p>

<p>
He rang his knuckles against José's great green
bowl.  Then his quick eye noticed that the best chair
in the house was at the right of the table-head.
</p>

<p>
"H'llo!" he said, "Isabel on your right?  Of
course.  Couldn't be anywhere else.  Now mind:
you've got to tell me what you think of her&mdash;just what
you really and truly and honestly think.  Where are
you putting the Excellent Creature?"
</p>

<p>
"At the foot," said Antonio.  "Between your excellent
self and your excellent father.  On your left
you'll have the excellent Isabel.  On my left I shall
have the excellent Sir Percival."
</p>

<p>
"Then Heaven help you," said young Crowberry.
"Still, you'll have Isabel on your right.  And be sure
to remember&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0403"></a></p>

<h3>
III
</h3>

<p>
Antonio hurried to the door.  His guests, with the
exception of Mrs. Baxter, who was following in the
chariot with a hamper of silver and linen, had reached
the little white gate of the garden.  Mr. Crowberry
rushed in first.
</p>

<p>
"Good, good, good," he cried, wringing the monk's
hand up and down.  Antonio noticed with pleasure
that his old employer now treated him as a social
equal; but it pleased him more and touched him
deeply to find that Mr. Crowberry was overflowing
with honest delight at his reunion with a friend.
</p>

<p>
Before he could reply he was being presented to Sir
Percival.  Sir Percival submitted to the ceremony
inattentively.  Nine-tenths of his wits were evidently
engaged with something or somebody else.  He was
a tall, thin, straight, soldierly man, whose scanty gray
hair and disproportionately luxuriant mustache made
his head look too small and bird-like.  His cheeks
were a trifle red, his gray eyes bright and restless.
As soon as one quick glance had assured him that
Antonio did not mean to do him any harm, he seemed
to lose interest in his host and in his surroundings.
</p>

<p>
With Sir Percival's daughter the case was different.
Antonio instantly became conscious that, after four
years of isolation, he was standing once more face to
face with a being of his own kind.  He felt, vaguely,
that this being was tall, graceful, feminine, proud, fine;
but it did not occur to him to take stock of her
features, or dress, or complexion.  Until later in the
afternoon, he could not have told young Crowberry
the color of her eyes, or whether she was dark or fair.
</p>

<p>
This had always been Antonio's way in the presence
of a woman.  When she happened to be handsome,
he felt unerringly and immediately her grace and
beauty; yet his first, involuntary, eager search was for
her spirit, for the inner self which might perchance be
peeping out from the depths of her eyes.  His own
eyes, dark and soft as brown velvet, could be in the
same moment both masterful and tender.  While he
was still a boy, a wise old woman had said of him:
"May God put it into his head to turn monk, for he
has eyes to break hearts."  Not that Antonio was
ever aware of looking at a woman otherwise than at
a man.  The habit was unconscious; but, for all the
purity and austerity of his heart and life, it was there.
It was not a fault.  One might as well have blamed
him for his black hair or for his tallness.
</p>

<p>
Fifty times in the past Antonio's glance had flashed
forth to probe fifty pairs of eyes.  Black eyes, blue
eyes, hazel eyes, gray eyes, brown eyes&mdash;he had
glanced into them all.  Very often this swift glance
had encountered maiden shyness and confusion; very
seldom it had struck against brazen immodesty, like
a sword against a shield.  Once it had met a devil,
a devil from hell, all the uglier because of the possessed
woman's sweet pink cheeks and gold-crowned white
brow.  Twice or thrice it had peered into bottomless
lakes of pity; and twenty times it had surprised a
craving for human kindness, a hunger and thirst for
Antonio's or some other love.  But, when Mr. Crowberry
began reciting his formula of introduction, the
monk's keen glance met something it had never met
before.
</p>

<p>
What his glance met was a glance more searching
than his own; a still swifter glance which encountered
his, like one mailed knight encountering another; a
stronger, more impetuous glance which overmastered
his and hurled it back.  This glance came from
beautiful eyes which were neither hard nor cold; but
Antonio was too much taken aback to notice their
heavenly blue.  Unlike his, the lady's glance did not
seem to be habitual.  It seemed, on the contrary, to
be something against the grain of her pride; something
peculiar to an abnormal moment of her life.  Of this
the monk was speedily assured by the slight flush
which warmed her cheeks as she turned the blue eyes
away.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Crowberry put an end to the embarrassment.
As tumultuously as a cart discharging a thousand of
bricks, he expressed, in a single outburst, his joy at
seeing Antonio, his detestation of Portugal, his
ravenous hunger and raging thirst, and also some sudden
animosity against his headlong heir.  He wound up
by demanding an immediate view of the champagne.
</p>

<p>
Antonio promised to give Mr. Crowberry satisfaction
at a later stage.  He explained that the dark and
chilly cellar was no place for a lady at any time, and
that even Mr. Crowberry could not go in and out of
it with impunity during the heat of the afternoon.
But the vineyards, he said, could be seen; also the <i>chais</i>
or over-ground cellars, the patent wine-plant from
Bordeaux, the Irish pot-still for the orange brandy,
and some of the casks of Portuguese claret which
England might expect to receive in twelve months'
time.
</p>

<p>
At that minute young Crowberry joined them.  He
was alternately sucking and rubbing one of his fingers
which he had just burned while interfering with José
in the kitchen.  As the others moved off towards the
nearer vines the young man detained Antonio and dug
mysteriously into the monk's ribs with his unburnt
hand.
</p>

<p>
"What d'ye think of Isabel Kaye-Templeman?" he
muttered.
</p>

<p>
"How do I know?  What do you think of yourself?"
Antonio retorted.  And he hurried after his
guests, without waiting for an answer.
</p>

<p>
Sir Percival allowed his body to be marched round
about Antonio's domain and in and out of the chais:
but his mind and soul persisted in sticking fast
somewhere else.  While Antonio was explaining the
Bordeaux wine-press, the baronet abruptly whipped out
a pocket-book and began scribbling some figures which
did not appear to have much connection with wine.
Mr. Crowberry was equally trying.  He asked Antonio
at least forty questions, most of them extremely
technical; but he did not listen to more than half a
dozen of the monk's answers.  As for Isabel, although
she accompanied the others in a dutiful manner and
listened to all Antonio said, she hardly spoke.
Antonio divined what it was that vexed her.  At the
moment of the introduction she had counted on seeing
before she was seen.
</p>

<p>
The dinner-bell jangled punctually at four o'clock.
Mrs. Baxter had arrived, along with a Portuguese
servant who was already on good terms with José in
the kitchen.  The Excellent Creature had brought
three knives, three forks, two spoons, and a napkin
for each person, as well as eighteen finely-cut
wine-glasses.  She was a stoutish little person, looking like
an old maid of the middle class, but with unmistakable
aspirations to the dignity of what she called "a
decayed gentlewoman."  Young Crowberry presented
Antonio to her in a set speech.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," he said, making a low bow and sweeping
the floor with the brim of his hat, "I trust I have your
leave to introduce the worthy Senhor Oliveira da
Rocha, whose lowly roof you are honoring by your
presence.  His rugged frame conceals an honest
heart; and, while he sets before us our frugal fare, I
make bold to hope that the evident sincerity of his
welcome will assist you to condone the inevitable
defects of his hospitality.  Senhor da Rocha, I have the
good fortune to make you acquainted with a gracious
lady, and one of the chief ornaments of her sex, than
whom the world contains no more Excellent Creature,
Mrs. Baxter."
</p>

<p>
Antonio heard the first sentences of this harangue
with horror.  Such merciless teasing of a woman, a
poor woman, a helpless widow, a dependent who could
hardly retaliate, stung his ears.  But he soon
discovered that Mrs. Baxter had not yet found young
Crowberry out.  She heard him with approval, and
received Antonio's greetings in a condescending manner.
</p>

<p>
When they entered the dining-room the soup was on
the table.  José's old spoons made so evident an
impression on Mrs. Baxter that young Crowberry turned
to her and said:
</p>

<p>
"Madam, it is hoped that we shall see our way to
leave at least two of them behind."
</p>

<p>
Whenever Mrs. Baxter could not understand young
Crowberry's remarks she bestowed upon him a
beaming smile.  Antonio, whose blood had run cold,
breathed again as the smile appeared; but he felt some
apology was needed for such perilous jesting at his
table.  In a low voice he said to Isabel, who was on
his right:
</p>

<p>
"As that young man's old tutor, I fear he hardly
does me credit."
</p>

<p>
"As Mrs. Baxter's old pupil," Isabel answered,
"I'm sure she doesn't mind."
</p>

<p>
This time their eyes met more guardedly; but there
was still much in the lady's glance which the monk
could not fathom.  It was as though their acquaintanceship
already had a past, and was to have a future;
as though they had often sat side by side before,
eating and drinking or talking together; as though they
were bearing themselves formally before fellow-guests
who could not be allowed to suspect their good
comradeship; as though they had a thousand confidences
whereof to disburden themselves so soon as
they should be alone.  Not that Antonio made any
such complete analysis as this while he was ladling
out the soup from the green bowl.  He was conscious
of little more than a fine pleasure in the presence of
this beautiful English girl who was entering so
willingly and naturally into his rough life.
</p>

<p>
Everybody praised the cream of cauliflowers.  In
default of soup-plates, it was ladled into small round,
gaily-painted dishes, about four inches deep.  A dozen
of them had cost Antonio the equivalent of an English
shilling at the fair of Santa Iria a year before.
All the dishes differed in pattern and color.  Young
Crowberry was the first to eat his last spoonful of
soup; and, having done so, he discovered at the
bottom of his dish a violet leopard, with green spots,
climbing a pink tree.  He shoved it towards Mrs. Baxter.
</p>

<p>
"Alas, madam," he said.  "The pity of it.  How
sad that the industrious artist whose work I am
contemplating should have lacked those blessings of
education which you, ma'am, are so signally qualified to
impart!  I protest that neither this cærulean
quadruped nor the blushing vegetable to whose apex he
aspires are to be found figured on any of the numerous
pages which the late spendthrift Goldsmith devoted to
the description of Animated Nature.  I protest&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
So did Crowberry <i>père</i>, who had been listening to
some eager talk of Sir Percy's.  He gave Crowberry
<i>fils</i> a kick under the narrow table, and once more lent
Sir Percy his right ear.
</p>

<p>
"Mine," said Isabel to Antonio, "is a blue bird, with
an orange-colored tail.  I should love to eat soup
every night out of this nest of his."
</p>

<p>
"It is your own," said Antonio.  "I will send it up
to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
Not knowing the Portuguese etiquette which prescribed
that Antonio should make the offer and that
she should decline it, Isabel simply spoke what was in
her heart.
</p>

<p>
"Mine?" she said gratefully.  "How good you are!
But no.  It's old and valuable.  I could never think
of it."
</p>

<p>
"Very old," smiled Antonio.  "The potter made it
last year for the village fair.  And very valuable.
My man, José, bought twelve of them for a penny
each.  It is not worth naming."
</p>

<p>
At the news that she could possess the blue and
orange bird without leaving her host more than one
penny the worse Isabel was as pleased as a child.
Meanwhile, Sir Percy continued his conversation with
Mr. Crowberry and ignored his daughter.  A Portuguese
papa would have kept sharp ears and eyes upon
his offspring; but the monk knew too much of
English ways to be surprised.
</p>

<p>
José stamped in with the trout.  When he had set
them down and there was no further risk of his dropping
both fishes and dishes on the stone floor, Antonio
disclosed his name, his offices, and his virtues to
the company, in English and in Portuguese.  José
blushed, saluted, and fled.
</p>

<p>
Within a ten-mile radius of the abbey less than a
hundredweight of butter was churned in the whole
year.  Not an ounce was made by José.  As for the
olive oil, Antonio distrusted its fineness.  Accordingly
the trout had been simply steamed.  They were
served with a sauce made from the yolks of eggs,
cream, and the juice of lemons.  The host saw with
pride that this dish was a success; but Sir Percy
cleared his plate without seeming to know whether he
was eating a mountain trout or a red herring.  At
last, when José was taking away the plates, he swung
round towards Antonio like a weathercock on a rusty
pivot, and said abruptly:
</p>

<p>
"Senhor Rocha, I hear you know all about alujezos."
</p>

<p>
"Azulejos," interrupted Mr. Crowberry, correcting
him.
</p>

<p>
"Ajulezos," snapped Sir Percy, without turning his
head.
</p>

<p>
"It's a hard word to pronounce," said Antonio;
"and a strange word altogether.  As azulejos are little
blue-and-white tiles, one would naturally think that it
is derived from azul, our Portuguese word for 'blue,'
and <i>ej</i>, one of our diminutives&mdash;a bluelet, a blueling,
a little thing of blue.  But that's a pure coincidence.
The word comes straight from the Arabic."
</p>

<p>
Sir Percy stared.  Antonio thought he was incredulous.
</p>

<p>
"I mean the word, not the thing," he explained.
"The azulejos up at the abbey are not Moorish, of
course.  They are of the seventeenth century,
produced under Dutch influence, but far finer, I think,
than any Delft.  All the same, we have genuine
Moorish azulejos in Portugal; for example, in the
Palace at Cintra."
</p>

<p>
Sir Percy stared harder than ever.
</p>

<p>
"We'll talk about it later on.  Not now.  After
dinner," said Mr. Crowberry hastily.  "Sir Percy,
you've not tasted your wine."
</p>

<p>
The wine-merchant himself had already tasted three
glasses.  The wine was a white wine, somewhat
resembling a very dry sherry, but as refreshing as young
Moselle.  The two Crowberrys praised its clearness,
Isabel admired its color, Mrs. Baxter said it was a
little sour, and Sir Percy, having drained his glass at
a single gulp, kindly said he would have some more.
</p>

<p>
The lifting of the great casserole's lid filled the
room with fragrant vapors.  With this dish José
served a salad of bitter oranges and three bottles of
the farm's best red wine.  Mrs. Baxter said that this
wine would be improved by the addition of a little hot
water, nutmeg, and honey.  Unhappily the Crowberrys,
whose hearts were with the ports and fruity Burgundies,
also failed to note its subtler beauties.
Nevertheless, the older Crowberry drank a whole bottle
by himself, and then loudly insisted on trying the
new champagne.
</p>

<p>
"We demand it, dead or alive," said young Crowberry.
</p>

<p>
The champagne was brought at last.  José walked
in with it slowly, holding it neck downwards.  Antonio
rose, took the bottle to the doorway and released
the cork.  With a cunning movement he reverted the
bottle the instant the explosion had disgorged the
sediment.  When he poured out the liquid, the bubbles
danced like diamonds upon amber.  It was not very
good wine; but the excitements attending it put
everybody into a good temper, Sir Percy not excepted.
</p>

<p>
The remaining delicacies were set on the table all
at once.  For the ladies Antonio had taken care to
provide two dishes of sweets.  The first was filled
with heart-shaped marmeladas, or quince jellies, firm
enough to cut with a knife and not in the least sticky.
The second was a custard of goat's milk and eggs,
flavored with spices and white wine.  There were also
six tiny snow-white cheeses, some fine broas, and a
pyramid of grandly colored fruits.  The coffee, for
once, was not grain-and-dandelion, but real Brazilian.
</p>

<p>
Knowing Mr. Crowberry's weakness, the monk
signed to José that he should serve the brandy in small
glasses, and that he should not leave the flasks on the
table.  When the cigar-box went round, Mr. Crowberry
did not recognize it as one which Antonio had
received in his presence four years before, a thousand
miles away.  His mind was busy with another
thought.  Filling up his largest glass with white wine,
he rose to his feet, cleared his throat, and said
pompously:
</p>

<p>
"To the Queens of England and Portugal.  May
their Majesties and their subjects be happy.  God
save the Queens."
</p>

<p>
Everybody stood up and drank.  José, knowing
that some good work was a-doing, saluted.  But
when the others sat down again, Mr. Crowberry
remained standing.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't done yet," he said.  "There's another
toast.  Ladies and gentlemen, I take leave to propose
the health of Senhor Francisco Manoel Oliveira da
Rocha.  May God forgive him for having such a
name.  Ladies and gentlemen, he's a jolly good fellow.
Personally, I don't like his claret; but, to be
candid, I don't like anybody's.  I've tasted worse
stuff from Bordeaux at half a guinea a bottle."
</p>

<p>
Young Crowberry applauded noisily.  Mrs. Baxter,
who had dined well, blinked at the speaker like a
sleepy pussy-cat.  Sir Percival listened with almost
excessive politeness.  He had emerged from his
abstraction, and was ashamed of his earlier
brusqueness.  Isabel's gaze was riveted on her painted
plate.
</p>

<p>
"When I reflect," continued Mr. Crowberry, "that
Senhor da Rocha has accomplished all this on a few
guineas of capital and almost single-handed, I am
more than ever proud to be his friend.  The weeks I
passed with him in England were the pleasantest of
my life.  Sir Percy ... Ladies ... I congratulate
you on your neighbor.  He has given us a
dinner fit for kings.  I say once more, he's a jolly
good fellow, and I empty my glass to his lifelong
health and happiness."
</p>

<p>
Young Crowberry, using both hands, rattled the
blades of two knives against the rims of two plates, at
the same time stamping on the stone floor and yapping
out, "Hear, hear!" in a voice like a terrier's bark.
The toast was drunk.
</p>

<p>
Antonio rose to respond.  But it was nearly half a
minute before he opened his mouth.  Mr. Crowberry's
unexpected compliment gave him an opportunity for
which he was unprepared, and English was not his
native tongue.  At last he said:
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Crowberry, ladies and gentlemen.  I cannot
accept your compliments, for I do not deserve them;
but I thank you most heartily for your kind wishes.
I thank you, also, for the honor you have done me in
coming to this little house.  You, sir, have kindly
spoken of our picnic as a dinner; but I am under no
delusions, and I thank you, most of all, for your
leniency towards our roughness and shortcomings."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Baxter graciously inclined her head, as if to
bestow a plenary indulgence where it was urgently
needed; but the others cried, "No!  Not at all!"
</p>

<p>
"And now," Antonio went on, "I have a toast on
my own account, though I'm the only one to drink it.
I propose the health of my guests.  Mr. Crowberry's
was the only face I knew when I landed in your
beautiful England, and his was the last face I saw when
I sailed away.  Without his generosity I might not
be on this farm to-day.  It does me good to see him
again.  He is&mdash;I hope I'm pronouncing the word
right&mdash;he's a jolligoodfellow."
</p>

<p>
"And so say I," sang out young Crowberry.
"He's a block of the young chip."
</p>

<p>
"As for Sir Percival Kaye-Templeman and ...
and Her Ladyship," added the monk, suddenly becoming
hazy as to the status of a baronet's daughter, "I
am indeed happy to have such neighbors.  We place
our services, such as they are, entirely at their
Excellencies' disposal; and at Madame Baxter's also.
Mr. Crowberry, you are aware, sir, that I used to work in
the abbey vineyards, over seven years ago.  I knew
all the monks.  I knew the old Abbot.  He was a
saint.  He died a day or two after they turned him
out, at Navares, the little town you passed through
this morning.  So it is natural I should have a great
deal of reverence for the old place.  And I am thankful,
more thankful than words can express, that it has
passed to owners who will not hold so sacred a spot in
disrespect.  Often and often I have feared for its
fate."
</p>

<p>
An awkward silence followed Antonio's speech.
Mr. Crowberry fidgeted in his chair.  Isabel colored
warmly, and Sir Percy straightened his back more
stiffly than ever.  Suddenly young Crowberry came
to the rescue with a comical wail.
</p>

<p>
"What about Me?" he asked.  "I'm a guest, and
you haven't praised Me?  Why ain't I a
jolligoodfellow, too?"
</p>

<p>
"You are already jolly and, some day, I hope you
will be good," said Antonio, smiling good-humoredly
at his pupil.  "Ladies and gentlemen, with my whole
heart, I drink to you all."
</p>

<p>
Everybody turned to Sir Percy.  He seemed desirous
of responding, but something held him down.
Young Crowberry sprang into the breach once more.
</p>

<p>
"Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking," he
said, rising, "I will nevertheless, however, try to
attempt to endeavor to thank you on behalf of us all.
Now for my own toast.  The Ladies&mdash;God bless
'em.  Senhor, I believe you have on your right a Lady
Abbess who will give you every satisfaction.  If,
however, Her Ladyship should fail in anything, you have
only to report the matter to Madame Baxter.  I drain
my glass to the Ladies."
</p>

<p>
The four men drank.  Isabel darted a grateful
glance at young Crowberry, as if to thank him for
delivering her from a painful situation; but he did not
see it.  Mrs. Baxter sat up, gasped, blushed, and
managed to say:
</p>

<p>
"I am sure, Mr. Edward, we are very much obliged."
</p>

<p>
"Last not least, here's to José, the cook," cried
young Crowberry, and, raising his voice, he called
through the door in Portuguese: "Hola, José, how the
devil are we to drink your health when there isn't any
more wine?"
</p>

<p>
After José had been toasted and had saluted in
response, Antonio suggested that he had detained his
visitors too long, and that they were doubtless
wishing to see more of their new home before dark.  Sir
Percy seemed grateful.  Pulling himself together, he
acknowledged the monk's hospitality with almost
excessive earnestness, and pressed him to come often to
the abbey.  They walked together to the road.
</p>

<p>
"And I am truly to have the blue-and-orange bird?"
said Isabel.  "You're sure you won't miss him very
much?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit," said Antonio.  "I know he will have a
good home."
</p>

<p>
He stood watching the chariot as it rolled away.
At the bend of the road she turned and waved her
hand.
</p>

<h3>
IV
</h3>

<p>
The wine-merchant and his son did not drive home
with Sir Percy and the ladies.  They preferred to
walk.
</p>

<p>
"Now then," demanded Crowberry <i>fils</i>, pouncing
upon Antonio as he returned from the gate.  "Out
with it.  What do you think of Isabel?"
</p>

<p>
But Crowberry <i>père</i>, following hard on his heels,
swiftly sent the youth about his business.  He wanted
ten minutes' talk, he said, with Antonio alone.
</p>

<p>
"Da Rocha," he began, as they paced the shady
length of the chief pergola; "believe me, it was one of
the greatest disappointments of my life when I could
not lend you the two thousand pounds you wrote for.
If I'd only had sense enough to stick to wine, you
could have had the money twice over in a jiffy.  But
I'm up to the ears in these damned railways; and
Heaven only knows what will be the end."
</p>

<p>
"A big profit, I hope," said the monk.
</p>

<p>
"More likely a big smash.  But leave all that.  It's
too late to alter it.  Now, about these abbey vineyards.
It struck me that I might get somebody to buy the
buildings and to lease you the vineyards on easy
terms.  The only man I could think of was Sir Percy.
I knew he was finding England a bit uncomfortable.
You see, he's gone through nearly all his money."
</p>

<p>
"How?  Gambling?  Drinking?  Or what?"
</p>

<p>
"Worse.  Inventions.  He worshiped his young
wife.  She died suddenly, and I think it turned him a
bit mad.  Anyhow, he's gone through two fortunes.
All spent on experiments and patents.  He has
invented dozens of things people don't want.  Ten
thousand pounds went over a balloon with wings and
a rudder.  He has perfected a substitute for indigo;
but it costs twice as much as the genuine article.  I
believe his new way of boring cannons has been taken
up by the Government; but an artillery colonel stole
the idea and collared all the profits.  I don't doubt
Sir Percy has invented a thing or two this very day,
at your table."
</p>

<p>
"You say he has spent all his money," objected
Antonio.  "If so, how could he buy the abbey?"
</p>

<p>
"Wait," said Mr. Crowberry.  "Men like Sir Percy
can't get down to their last penny as easily as you or
I.  Sir Percy's is an old family&mdash;older than any of
our dukes, save one.  Families like those are all spread
out, through intermarriage.  There's always some
aunt or cousin, when it comes to the worst, who will
send you five hundred pounds and a nasty letter.  In
this case, Sir Percy got the five hundred near home.
It was his daughter Isabel's.  She has a separate estate
that can't be pawned.  This five hundred came out of
income."
</p>

<p>
"But the price of the abbey was three thousand
pounds."
</p>

<p>
"Don't interrupt.  It was three thousand guineas.
That is, three thousand pounds for the Lisbon
Government and three hundred for the Fazenda official.
Two thousand eight hundred remain to be paid."
</p>

<p>
Antonio's heart brimmed with wrath and shame and
bitterness.
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't have managed it but for an amazing
stroke of luck," Mr. Crowberry continued.  "Over
these damned railways, I got mixed up with a sort of
broker who knew all about Portugal.  I don't like
him; but he's a mighty clever fellow.  Perhaps you
know him.  He got a peerage from your Government
for lending them money at forty per cent.  He's the
Viscount de Ponte Quebrada."
</p>

<p>
Antonio succeeded in remaining silent.
</p>

<p>
"Strangely enough, he knew this very abbey.  It
was the week after I had your letter.  I told him
that a friend of mine wanted to buy the vineyards;
and he recognized the name of the place at once.  I
tried to get him to lend you two thousand on it; but
he wouldn't do it to a stranger.  Then I asked him to
lend it to Sir Percy; and he seemed quite struck with
the idea.
</p>

<p>
"That very night he went and saw Sir Percy on his
own account, and they made some sort of three-cornered
bargain.  The Viscount has squared the
Fazenda, and he's given Sir Percy introductions for
getting a railway concession&mdash;Lisbon to Oporto&mdash;worth
millions!  I suspect the Viscount will get the
millions, and Sir Percy will be the figure-head.  As
for the two thousand eight hundred, they've to pay
three hundred on New Year's Day, and the balance
in five half-yearly instalments."
</p>

<p>
"Who will pay?  The Viscount?  Or the daughter Isabel?"
</p>

<p>
"Keep quiet.  It seems the Viscount told Sir
Percy, on the quiet, that there are several jobs about
this abbey which they can work together.  He
mentioned one.  These al&mdash;I mean, azulejos.  Sir Percy
has invented a way of getting them down."
</p>

<p>
Antonio's heart almost stood still.
</p>

<p>
"They can't, they daren't," he cried at last.  "Till
the abbey is wholly paid for, how dare they?"
</p>

<p>
"Who's to object?  Hasn't the Fazenda man got
three hundred, all for himself?  Isn't he going to do
anything to earn the money?  Da Rocha, I always
said you were not a man of the world.  They dare,
they can, and they will rip down those damned old
tiles.  And when they've got them down here they're
going to get them down in other places&mdash;other old
convents.  The Viscount can get six hundred pounds
a set.  They're wanted for museums and galleries."
</p>

<p>
"He can get at least a thousand," cried Antonio.
</p>

<p>
"So much the better for Sir Percy and the Viscount.
That's how the twenty-eight hundred is to be paid.
It'll be all right.  Now, about your lease of the
vineyards."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Crowberry," said Antonio, halting and looking
with a white face at his friend.  "Don't think me
ungrateful.  But this hurts me to the quick.  What if
the monks should return to buy back their own?  Nay,
less.  What if one of them should merely revisit it?
Those azulejos were their chief pride.  What will
they say when they know that this, in a sense, is my
doing; that it wouldn't have happened if I had never
written to you for money?"
</p>

<p>
"Who's going to tell 'em?" demanded the other,
vexed.  "If you don't, nobody else will."
</p>

<p>
"Whether they ever know it or not," said Antonio,
"I tell you I'd rather you should pluck out one of my
eyes than tear down those azulejos."
</p>

<p>
"Then you deserve to have been born one-eyed,"
retorted Mr. Crowberry, thoroughly aroused.  "I
never heard such tomfoolery in my life.  This is what
I get for trying to do you a good turn.  Gad!  As if
you didn't put enough of a wet blanket on us all when
you proposed our healths!  I'll tell you what it is.
There's too much damnable gush in this hole of a
Portugal, and that's why you're all beggars."
</p>

<p>
Antonio was about to reply hotly; but the
wine-merchant stopped him.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said, "I take that back.  We won't
quarrel.  But you've upset me badly.  I go away on
Thursday or Friday.  We've only one clear day to
fix this lease.  Don't be a fool."
</p>

<p>
"If the azulejos cannot be spared," replied Antonio,
terribly agitated, "I cannot become Sir Percy's tenant."
</p>

<p>
"But, my ridiculous friend, look here.  Sir Percy
doesn't want a tenant&mdash;neither you nor anybody else.
He's leasing you the vineyards to oblige me.  D'ye
expect me to go and make conditions when he's doing
you a favor?"
</p>

<p>
Antonio began pacing up and down, with bent head
and hands clasped behind his back.  He strode, six
steps this way and six steps back, over and over again,
with a feverish tread, like an animal in a cage.  After
a full minute he threw up his head, and said:
</p>

<p>
"Do me one more kindness.  Give me till to-morrow.
In the afternoon I will come to the guest-house,
to bring a little bowl for Miss Kaye-Templeman.  Till
then, I beg that you will not say a word of this to
anyone?"
</p>

<p>
Waving down Mr. Crowberry's wrath with an imperious
hand, he plunged under the orange trees.  The
Englishman took a couple of steps after him; then
he shrugged his shoulders and strolled back to the
house.
</p>

<p>
"What do you really and truly think of Isabel?"
asked young Crowberry, who had headed Antonio off
among the trees.  This time he meant to have his
answer.
</p>

<p>
The monk looked at him sadly, and passed a hand
over his burning eyes.
</p>

<p>
"The Senhorita and I talked very little," he replied.
"So far as I know, I like her."
</p>

<p>
"Is she pretty?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"And clever?"
</p>

<p>
"I think so."
</p>

<p>
"She's as clever as a don.  That's the trouble.
All head, no heart.  And as proud as Lucifer."
</p>

<p>
Young Crowberry saw that Antonio could hardly
endure his chatter.
</p>

<p>
"Something's wrong," he said, with genuine concern
in his boyish voice.  "What are you down in the
doleful dumps for?"
</p>

<p>
At first Antonio shook his head.  But the youth's
frank distress touched him.  The trouble was too
great to be confined within one breast; so he detailed
Sir Percy's plan.  When he had finished he added:
</p>

<p>
"But why should I worry you with all this?  You
are young, you are buoyant.  You have been brought
up amidst different religious ideas.  This is a matter
you cannot understand."
</p>

<p>
Young Crowberry gripped the monk's fore-arm
with a quick, fierce grip.  As he let it drop, he retorted
intensely:
</p>

<p>
"Senhor da Rocha, as you say, I am young.  But
even I have learned one thing that you haven't.
There is not always a merry heart under a cap and
bells.  My jabber is flippant, no doubt.  But
... but God knows how much I care for the things you
say I can't understand."
</p>

<p>
Antonio was startled clean out of his trouble.
</p>

<p>
"You don't mean to tell me, Edward," he said,
"that you have begun to care about religion&mdash;to care
deeply with all your heart?"
</p>

<p>
The youth bowed his head.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me how much you mean," Antonio demanded
eagerly.
</p>

<p>
But Mr. Crowberry appeared in the doorway of the
house and stepped out to join them.  His son saw him,
and said hurriedly in Antonio's ear:
</p>

<p>
"We leave on Thursday.  I want a talk&mdash;a long
one, a quiet one.  Your man José told me a tale about
a ghost in the chapel.  I said I would watch there
to-morrow night.  I can get the key.  Say that you
will join me.  But not a word to anybody."
</p>

<p>
After a second's consideration, Antonio promised.
And when a quarter of an hour later he said his
farewells at the farm-gate he added softly, in young
Crowberry's ear:
</p>

<p>
"Till to-morrow night ... among the azulejos."
</p>

"The gentlemen are all down at the other buildings,"
said the English maid-servant who opened the guest-house
door to Antonio.  "I think they said they would
be in the chapel.  Miss Kaye-Templeman is in, and
Mrs. Baxter."
</p>

<p>
The monk hesitated.  After a single meeting, would
it be correct to ask for Sir Percy's daughter instead of
finding Sir Percy himself?  He was not sure.  Yet his
dread and loathing of what the Englishman might be
doing in the chapel held him back from following.
Antonio knew his limitations.  After all, he was still
flesh and blood, and he could not be sure of mastering
his wrath in the presence of a sacrilegious despoiler.
</p>

<p>
"You may tell Miss Kaye-Templeman that Mr. Oliveira
da Rocha is here," he said.
</p>

<p>
After he had repeated his name twice, the maid led
him into the tiny ante-chamber.  Antonio saw that the
engraved portrait of Saint Benedict had been taken
down.  It was leaning in a corner, face to the wall;
and, in its stead, hung a small oil-painting of two
horses and a stable-boy, in the manner of Morland.
The large crucifix had been removed from the place of
honor; but its shape could still be seen, like the shadow
of a dim cross on the white wall.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Oliver Kosher," mumbled the maid to
somebody in the principal room.
</p>

<p>
As Antonio passed through the inner door he saw
that Isabel was alone.  She rose and came forward
with such complete control of her blue eyes that the
monk had a momentary fear of not being wanted.
But there was warmth in her voice and a welcome in
her smile.  When she caught sight of the gaudy bowl
in her visitor's hand she gave a little cry of unaffected
joy.
</p>

<p>
"You've brought the blue bird," she said.  "I felt
quite sure you would forget all about him.  How can
I thank you properly?"
</p>

<p>
"By saying no more about such a trifle," answered
Antonio, placing the bowl in her hand.
</p>

<p>
Hardly listening, she turned her treasure this way
and that, as if it had been a piece of Sèvres.  For the
first time Antonio was able to look at her critically.
She was only a head shorter than himself; which
meant that she was taller than six women out of seven.
She stood up as straight as her father; but, while Sir
Percy looked as though he had swallowed a steel
ramrod, Isabel Kaye-Templeman was as graceful and
supple as a perfectly-grown young tree.  She was
slender, yet so exquisitely developed in proportion to her
height that Antonio felt he was never likely to see a
more perfect figure.  Her abundant hair was
brown-golden&mdash;perhaps more golden than brown&mdash;and as
fine as threads of silk.
</p>

<p>
Finding the Portuguese October warmer than an
English July, Isabel had put on a high-waisted,
full-skirted dress of pink-sprigged muslin.  Over the
shoulders, which were cut rather low, she wore a
gauzy scarf, unprimly fastened at the throat by an
unjeweled brooch of old gold.  As she fondled the
penny bowl Antonio observed the fine whiteness and
slenderness of her wrists and fingers and the high-bred
grace of every little movement.
</p>

<p>
"You will excuse Mrs. Baxter?" Isabel asked,
suddenly coming back to formality.  "She lies down in
the afternoon.  My father and the others are at the
abbey.  Shall we go down and join them?  They
expect you.  I think they want you to help them."
</p>

<p>
"Let us join them," said the monk.
</p>

<p>
While Isabel was upstairs putting on her gloves and
hat Antonio paced up and down the familiar room.  A
carpet, some easy chairs, two small tables, and very
many pictures and ornaments had already been
unpacked.  Most of these importations were pleasing in
themselves; but they were incongruous with a Portuguese
interior, especially when it was the interior of a
semi-monastic building.  Antonio, however, hardly
gave all this bric-à-brac a glance.  He was revolving
in his mind, for the twentieth time, a bold plan.
</p>

<p>
With a promptitude which contradicted one of the
monk's delusions about ladies, Isabel reappeared in a
large straw hat and announced that she was ready.
They started at once.  But, instead of taking the
direct road, the monk chose a roundabout path to the
abbey.
</p>

<p>
"This is not the way," said Isabel, halting after they
had walked forty or fifty yards.
</p>

<p>
"It is not the shortest way, but it is the best,"
Antonio answered.  "It takes only five minutes longer
and it passes the most beautiful spot in the whole
domain."
</p>

<p>
She seemed a shade vexed, and did not speak again
until they reached the spot of which Antonio had
spoken.  It was part of a ravine.  Rustic steps led
down to the margin of the water, which broadened in
this place to a rippling pool.  From a face of brown
rock, to the right, the bright torrent came tumbling
in a thunderous cascade.  To the left, at the lower end
of the pool, it raced seawards almost hidden in a leafy,
ferny, stony channel, whence its voice ascended like
the throbbing, booming sound of an organ.  Generation
after generation of monkish gardeners had chosen
this sheltered spot for the rearing of their most
precious trees.  Araucarias, deodars, date-palms, and
cedars of Lebanon were mingled with cork-oaks,
eucalyptus, willows, sea-pines, plum-trees, planes, and
chestnuts.  Ten or twelve tree-ferns overtopped by
a giant palm suggested a tropical forest.  Stepping-stones
had been fixed in the pool at its narrowest part,
and on the other bank was a grotto-chapel hewn in the
face of a boulder as big as a house.
</p>

<p>
The stepping-stones were slippery with spray from
the loud cascade; but Isabel tripped from one to
another confidently and easily, scarcely touching
Antonio's proffered hand.  On the further bank she
paused, to take breath, and stood gazing westward.
Below her lay a hundred acres of wood, softly musical
with the twittering and singing of birds and with the
hum of the hidden torrent.  Further down rose the
monastery.  Beyond, in the plain, could be seen
Antonio's farm; and, still further to the west, the
Atlantic.
</p>

<p>
"This is the spot I meant," said Antonio.
</p>

<p>
"It is very beautiful," was all her answer.  She
spoke it in so cheerless a tone that Antonio was
concerned.
</p>

<p>
"England is beautiful too," he said.  "At first it
is only natural you should be homesick."
</p>

<p>
"Homesick?" she echoed, suddenly facing him with
defiant eyes.  "I'm not homesick.  I don't know
what it means.  I don't know what Home means,
either."
</p>

<p>
Antonio was startled.  Three or four speeches came
to his tongue's tip, some of them inquisitive, all of
them sympathetic.  Finally he said:
</p>

<p>
"Home is not built in a day.  I myself was not bred
and born in this part of Portugal.  At first every face
was strange.  But it is home now.  This torrent is the
stream that runs through the kitchen of the abbey
where I used to work.  It is the brook that refreshes
my little farm.  Once it was no more to me than so
many gallons of water.  Now it talks and sings to me
like a friend.  Little by little you will learn to love
this place."
</p>

<p>
"I loved it as soon as I saw it," she retorted.
"But I don't love it now.  I loved it for about three
hours."
</p>

<p>
"Three hours?  Why three hours?"
</p>

<p>
"We arrived here about noon.  We left about three.
I loved it till we came to your house for dinner.
Then..."
</p>

<p>
Antonio waited anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Then," she continued, with a visible effort, "I
... longed with all my soul to be back in
England.  You said ... you remember what you
said about our respecting this sacred place?"
</p>

<p>
"I remember," said Antonio, his heart swelling
with thankfulness.  He had cudgelled his wits in vain
for a way of introducing his plan; but here was the
opportunity ready to his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Well," she said, "we haven't come from England
to respect this sacred place in the least.  We have
come to ruin and defile it.  Those blue-and-white
tile-pictures in the chapel are the most wonderful things
I've ever seen; but we have come to tear them down.
We have come to use the big rooms and long corridors
for all sorts of experiments.  We shall make them
grimy with smoke and foul with fumes; and some fine
day we shall have an accident and blow the whole
place into the Atlantic, and ourselves with it."
</p>

<p>
Her bitter and vehement fluency struck the monk
dumb.
</p>

<p>
"That isn't all," she added more bitterly than ever.
"When they've fished us up out of the Atlantic and
dressed our wounds we shall start making plans for a
railway.  We shall lose all our own money and make
all the honest people in the district lose theirs too.
But what will it matter?  We shall get something for
our gold and silver.  We shall be honored with the
company of the men who're going to make fortunes
out of us and out of your country&mdash;men who don't
know their own grandfathers.  One of them will be
kind enough to buy this domain from us for an old
song and to build a fine square house out of the ruins.
Senhor da Rocha, that is the way we are going to
respect your sacred place."
</p>

<p>
Antonio succeeded in meeting her defiant gaze with
a show of calmness; but there was a tremor in his
voice as he said:
</p>

<p>
"If I did not know that the Senhorita is witty I
should say that the Senhorita is doing herself a little
injustice."
</p>

<p>
She knitted her brows while she framed an answer.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said.  "The Senhor is right.  The
Senhorita is doing herself a little injustice.  She ought
to add, in her own defense, that she wouldn't have
agreed so easily to come here had she known that
anybody cared about the place.  She thought nobody
would be one atom the worse, save the bats and
spiders.  Yesterday she learned the truth.  But she
learned it too late."
</p>

<p>
In his eagerness the monk strode close to her side.
</p>

<p>
"Too late?" he echoed.  "No, it is not too late.
You have great influence with your father.  There are
fifty places in Portugal cheaper and more accessible
and all together more convenient than this for your
experiments and your railways."
</p>

<p>
"Don't call them mine," she commanded.  "I hate
and loathe them all.  But, I repeat, it is too late.
Neither I nor anyone else in this world has a grain of
influence with my father.  Opposition drives him mad."
</p>

<p>
Her tone was even more decisive than her words.
But Antonio could not face the fact that he was beaten.
Had not Mr. Crowberry distinctly stated that Sir
Percy had gained possession of the abbey solely by the
help of Isabel's private fortune?  She was not a
schoolgirl.  She was of full age; and if she was
paying the piper surely she had something to do with
calling the tune.
</p>

<p>
Yet how was he to remind her of her rights?  Was
not his intervention sure to be resented as the extreme
of impertinence?  Mr. Crowberry had not said that
his revelations concerning the Kaye-Templeman
finances were made in confidence; but probably this
was an oversight of which it would be mean to take
advantage.
</p>

<p>
The painful silence lengthened.  Antonio ended it
by starting on a new line.
</p>

<p>
"Those tiles," he said, "are not mere curiosities, to
be carted about from one museum to another.  I feel
as if they are alive&mdash;as if your illustrious father will
be flaying a living thing when he tears them from the
wall.  They were not ordered from a shop, and
unpacked, and stuck all over the chapel like so much
wallpaper from Paris.  They represent the life and
miracles and martyrdom of a saint of this Order&mdash;a
saint of the Portuguese Benedictine congregation who
spent ten years in this monastery.  He died in your
England, for the Faith."
</p>

<p>
She moved uneasily.  Thinking he was gaining his
point Antonio continued:
</p>

<p>
"Those tiles were not the work of one hireling
artist.  In a sense the whole community drew and
painted them.  Until they were turned out the monks
cherished the archives of their abbey; and these
showed how, under three successive Abbots, the
cartoons gradually grew to perfection.  Look.  From
here you can see the cemetery where the bones of those
dead monks lie.  Their souls will bless you from
heaven if you will spare the chapel they made so
glorious."
</p>

<p>
"Senhor da Rocha," said Isabel, dryly and rather
coldly, "we are at cross purposes.  You will be
shocked; but I can't help it.  I don't believe in monks
and monasteries, nuns and nunneries.  The monks'
heaven is my hell.  Their God is my Devil.  Forgive
me if I hurt you; but it seems to me that there can be
only two kinds of monks.  Those who are not fanatics
are hypocrites; and those who are not hypocrites are
fanatics.  How can any really sane and honest man
worship the Creator by despising His creation?"
</p>

<p>
Antonio was about to reply, when she added hastily:
</p>

<p>
"No.  Forgive me.  I have spoken too plainly.
Let me return to the point.  I mean this: on behalf of
any ordinary man or woman who loves this place for
old sakes' sake I would work my hardest to spare it.
But not for dead monks."
</p>

<p>
"Then work your hardest for me," pleaded Antonio
eagerly.  "Don't you regard me as an ordinary man,
who loves the place for old sakes' sake?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't," she said, recovering her ease.  "You
are not an ordinary man.  You will grieve over the
azulejos for a few days; then, amidst your many
interests, you will forget them.  Or, better still, you
will come to be glad that they have been taken away
from a dark, shut-up hill-side sepulcher and placed
where millions of people can see them and admire
them."
</p>

<p>
"You mean," he said scornfully, "that if I were a
poor man; if I had a beautiful wife; if she and I had
grown up together almost from the cradle; if her life
were altogether bound up with mine&mdash;you mean that
if someone should take her away by force and show her
every night from the stage of a theater, to a thousand
people ... you mean, I ought to be grateful and
glad!"
</p>

<p>
His own illustration startled him.  It had leaped
into his mind and out from his lips without his consent.
It startled Isabel still more; for the tones in which it
was uttered were sharper than knives.  Once more she
lost the mastery over her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"We must be going," she said curtly, as soon as she
could frame a sentence.
</p>

<p>
They descended through the wood without further
speech until the monastery gleamed between the trees.
Then Isabel halted and said:
</p>

<p>
"You ought to believe that I am a better judge than
you of my father's character.  I repeat that I shall do
more harm than good by asking him to spare these
tiles.  To ask him such a thing will be a more difficult
and unpleasant task than you imagine.  But, if nothing
else will satisfy you, I will try."
</p>

<p>
"I thank you with all my soul," answered the monk.
"But I will exact no promises.  As you say, you are
the best judge."
</p>

<p>
"Let me speak one more word&mdash;for your comfort,"
she added.  "This morning my father returned from
the chapel dejected.  He is no longer confident that he
can strip the azulejos from the wall.  Remember, not
a single tile must be broken or the buyer will not have
them.  My father may fail."
</p>

<p>
"God grant he may," said Antonio fervently.
</p>

<p>
"You must indulge me," she answered, "if I find
it a trifle hard to say Amen."
</p>

<h3>
VI
</h3>

<p>
They found young Crowberry smoking a cigar
outside the principal door of the monastery.
</p>

<p>
"Are the others inside?" Isabel asked.
</p>

<p>
Young Crowberry meditated a few moments.
Then, with his hands clasped behind him, like a
dame-school child repeating a lesson, he answered in an
absurd monotone:
</p>

<p>
  "I am Abbot of all I survey,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My right there is none to dispute;<br>
  From the center right down to the say<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am free to behave like a brute."<br>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
"He is trying to make a parody on some lines by
Cowper, one of our English poets who died thirty or
forty years ago," Isabel explained to the bewildered
Antonio.  "I suppose he means the others have gone
back home."
</p>

<p>
"Our respective sires have verily got them gone,"
said young Crowberry.  And, dropping his affectation,
he added, "I don't know how you managed to
miss 'em, coming down from the house."
</p>

<p>
"Why have they gone away?"
</p>

<p>
"To mix a new mixture.  Sir Percy has an idea."
</p>

<p>
Isabel led the way into the monastery.  She entered
it with a proprietary air which made the monk suspect
that Sir Percy had deceived her and that she believed
the place to be wholly paid for.  Suspicion became
certainty.  He felt convinced that this was not a
woman who would knowingly lend herself to Sir
Percy's bargain with the Visconde.
</p>

<p>
"Show me one of the monks' cells," she commanded.
</p>

<p>
Antonio hesitated.  The spectacle of a graceful girl
tripping along the stern and dark corridors had already
given him a slight shock.  But the cells!  Into whose
cell could he take her?  Decidedly he had no right to
show her any save his own.
</p>

<p>
To his own they went.  The monk could never
enter the narrow room without emotion, and he was
forced to go to the window to hide his anguish.  What
if this should prove to be his last entrance?  What if
Sir Percy should indeed defile and destroy the whole
abbey?
</p>

<p>
"It's actually clean," said Isabel, amazed.
</p>

<p>
"What did you expect?" asked Antonio, turning
round and speaking coldly.
</p>

<p>
"I've no idea.  But I know I didn't expect
cleanliness," she said.  "Who is this bishop?  They seem
to have stuck his portrait up all over the place."
</p>

<p>
"He is not a bishop," put in young Crowberry.
"He is Saint Benedict, the great Abbot, father of all
the monks of the West."
</p>

<p>
Antonio started.  The young man's tone was
respectful, and it was evident that he was speaking
sympathetically of matters about which he had been
reading and thinking.  Isabel, however, took little
notice of the answer.  As usual, she hardly recognized
young Crowberry's continued existence.  One after
another she pulled out Antonio's empty drawers and
opened his empty cupboards.  Had she realized that
the monks had been expelled only seven years before
and that many of them must be still living, nothing in
the world would have induced her to pry into their
sancta; but it was evident that she pictured the monks
of Portugal pretty much as she pictured the monks of
old England.  To her they were forgotten men,
vanished into dust ages ago; and there could be no more
indelicacy in ransacking their old haunts than in
examining the sculptures of a long-empty sarcophagus.
</p>

<p>
From the cell they went to the cloister.  There
Isabel quickly espied the spiral staircase; and, having
ascended it, she sat down on Antonio's favorite seat
of cork.  The quiet beauty of the scene subdued her;
and not a syllable was spoken until they had retraced
their steps and reached the monks' entrance to the
chapel.
</p>

<p>
Before setting foot in the monastery young Crowberry
had thrown away his cigar; and on the chapel
threshold, with unostentatious reverence, he uncovered
his head.  They went in, young Crowberry leading.
</p>

<p>
No irreparable injury had been done.  Only in the
north-west corner of the nave was there any trace of
Sir Percy's operations.  He had taken down part of a
creamy marble cornice which ran along the top edge
of the azulejos, level with the sills of the high-placed
windows.  A circular saw occupied the marble's old
place.  On the floor were two carboys of acid, a short
ladder, and half a dozen chisels, large and small.
</p>

<p>
By tacit consent none of the three mentioned this
display of apparatus.  Indeed, they affected not to
see it.  Young Crowberry still took the initiative.
Standing opposite the western wall, he besought
Antonio to explain the azulejos.
</p>

<p>
The ten blue-and-white pictures were worked out
in tiles which encrusted the walls to a height of about
fifteen feet.  There was one on each side of the grand
western door, and there were four on each of the north
and south walls of the nave.  Each picture measured
about twelve feet across and was framed in decorative
tile-work wherein green and yellow were added to the
blue.  Antonio began on the right-hand side of the
western door.
</p>

<p>
"First," he said, "we have the Saint's birth.  Like
our divine Lord, he was born an outcast.  His mother
and father were on pilgrimage.  Notice the Latin
scroll, <i>Non erat eis locus in diversorio</i>: 'There was no
room for them in the inn.'  Through the trees you
see the village of Carcavoa as it was before the
earthquake, with a Gothic church and two spires."
</p>

<p>
The next picture was the one from which Sir Percy
had removed the cornice; but Antonio did not change
his tone.
</p>

<p>
"Second," he continued.  "The Saint's boyhood.
The book he is reading, in the shadow of the wayside
shrine, is the 'Little Hours of the Blessed Virgin.'  The
scroll reads, <i>Zelus domus tuae comedit me</i>: The
zeal of thy house hath eaten me up.'  The games the
other boys are playing are played in Portuguese
villages to-day.  The bullock-carts are unchanged also.
Notice the two cats&mdash;lanky cats with long clever heads;
they are Portuguese cats all over."
</p>

<p>
The third picture was pierced by the doorway
which gave access to the cloisters; and the designers of
the azulejos had made bold use of what might have
been a disfigurement.  The picture showed a small
monastery.  The gables, the dormer windows, the
round arches, and the stumpy belfry of this little
monastery were depicted in blue, on the tiles; but where
there ought to have been a blue-painted doorway one
saw the solid jamb and lintel of the doorway through
which young Crowberry and the others had entered
the chapel.  The figure of the Saint was nowhere to
be seen; but all the men and women in the picture were
crowding hurriedly towards the doorway as if they
would see the last of somebody who had passed into
the cloister.  Above the solid lintel chubby blue boys
were painted lying on their chests and trying to look
down into the building.
</p>

<p>
"The Saint," Antonio explained, "has entered a
religious house.  And as that religious house was this
very abbey, you see the point of the doorway.  On
the scroll, <i>Magister adest et vocat te</i>: 'The Master is
here and calleth thee.'"
</p>

<p>
Antonio successively pointed out the pictures of the
Saint's first Mass, with blue angels helping to uphold
the Chalice, and of the Saint's first miracle, with
Oporto in the distance.  This ended the series on the
north wall.  At the marble balustrade of the gilded
sanctuary, he explained the stalls, the retablo, and the
boldly-ribbed Gothic vaulting, at least a century older
than the nave.  Then he worked back along the south
wall, making short comments on the Saint's shipwreck
and second miracle, his preaching to prisoners, his
landing in England, and his visit to the Abbey of
Westminster, once Benedictine.
</p>

<p>
"Your Westminster Abbey looks strange," said
Antonio.  "It is before the alterations of Wren; but I
admit the faults of the picture.  The next one is
better.  It is the Saint's death at&mdash;I think you pronounce
it Tyburn.  The horses and most of the faces are quite
English.  The hurdle on which he has been drawn is
broken.  Notice the one-eyed man with the butcher's
knife.  On the scroll are the Saint's last words,
the same as Saint Stephen's, <i>Domine ne statuas
illis hoc peccatum</i>: 'Lord, lay not this sin to their
charge.'"
</p>

<p>
This tenth, and last of the tile-pictures was on the
left of the western door; but not until Antonio ceased
speaking did he notice a small leather-covered box
resting on the ground at the foot of the green and
yellow border of azulejos.  It was gilt-lettered
P. L. K.-T.  The lid was off, showing the stoppers of four
chemists' bottles and some fine steel tools.
</p>

<p>
In the same instant, both Antonio and young Crowberry
had the same thought.  "Lord, lay not this sin
to their charge."  The words were grimly appropriate
to Sir Percy's act of sacrilege; yet young Crowberry
felt sure that Antonio had only recognized their
appropriateness when it was too late.  As for the monk,
although his eyes met Isabel's for no more than a
moment, he saw that she was wounded.
</p>

<p>
"When was the Saint hanged?" asked young Crowberry,
in order to end the awkward pause.  "In what
reign?"
</p>

<p>
"In the reign of Isabel," Antonio answered.
</p>

<p>
Young Crowberry opened his eyes wide.  The
monk, however, had already realized his second mishap.
</p>

<p>
"I mean Elizabeth, Queen Elizabeth, of course," he
burst out.  "The Portuguese for Elizabeth is Isabel.
It's the same name."
</p>

<p>
But Miss Kaye-Templeman was already moving
towards the cloister doorway.  Antonio, suddenly
losing his English, turned desperately to young
Crowberry.
</p>

<p>
"You've done it this time," said the youth dolefully.
</p>

<p>
"Wait here," commanded Antonio, in Portuguese.
"Don't follow."
</p>

<p>
He sprang after the lady and overtook her in the
cloister, although she quickened her footsteps at the
noise of Antonio's.  When she saw that explanations
were inevitable, she got in the first word.
</p>

<p>
"Senhor da Rocha," she said, haughtily, "I am
willing&mdash;perhaps over willing&mdash;to be talked to.  But I
decline to be talked at.  This is your gratitude for my
offer of help.  As for 'the reign of Isabel,' I am too
dull to see the joke; but I can see the insult."
</p>

<p>
She walked on.
</p>

<p>
"Hear me one moment, I entreat," cried Antonio.
"Have we not, both you and I, enough troubles, solid
troubles?  I have told you some of mine; and,
although I do not know what they are, I can see that
you have great sorrows too.  For Heaven's sake let
us not add to them by needless misunderstandings."
</p>

<p>
He kept level with her as she walked; but she heard
him with averted eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I swear," he added, "that I was not talking at
you.  I swear I didn't catch sight of your father's
hateful tools till I had finished speaking.  As for 'the
reign of Isabel,' I am a Portuguese.  In Portuguese
King Charles is Carlos, King Edward is Duarte, King
James is Thiago, Queen Elizabeth is Isabel.  Those
bottles and tools upset me; and I forgot to translate
the name."
</p>

<p>
When he saw that she neither vouchsafed him an
answer nor paused in her walk his pride was roused.
</p>

<p>
"One minute more, and I will not trouble the
Senhorita again," he said, with as much hauteur as her
own.  "I have offered an explanation and I have
sworn that it is true.  As for insults, I never give
them, though I receive many.  You are neither
reasonable nor just.  I have done."
</p>

<p>
He was turning away.  But her pride broke down.
She stopped and faced him, and her blue eyes suddenly
shone with a rush of tears.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she cried.  "Scold me, abuse me, make me
wretched.  It doesn't seem natural for anybody to be
kind very long.  Hate the sight of me, like everybody
else.  Call me unreasonable.  So I am.  Call me
unjust.  So I am.  If there's anything more, I'm
ready."
</p>

<p>
Antonio stared at her in amazement as she clenched
her fine hands and stamped one of her small feet.
"All head and no heart," young Crowberry had said of
this poor Isabel; and, for twenty-four hours, the monk
had taken it for granted that young Crowberry was
right.  Yet, as she stood wet-eyed before him, she
seemed to be all one big, bursting, breaking heart.
</p>

<p>
Her tears helped him like lenses to read her through
and through.  He discerned the tragedy of her girlhood,
passed between a selfish woman and a father who
was half a madman.  He pictured her, dragged from
place to place, from failure to failure, from
humiliation to humiliation.  He understood why she had
builded icy barriers of pride to repel the insolent pity
of those who found entertainment in her father's
fiascos.  And he saw, what she did not see herself, that
under all her defenses and pretenses was the heart
of a little child.  He was filled with a yearning to
comfort her; but he could only stand and gaze at her
with infinite compassion.
</p>

<p>
"Yesterday," she went on, "I was happy.  But to-day..."
</p>

<p>
He waited for her to say "I am miserable."  But
she had seen the pity in his brown velvet eyes and it
stung her.
</p>

<p>
"To-day," she said, "I hate you!"
</p>

VII
</h3>

<p>
As the main path from the monastery to the
guest-house was broad and open, Miss Kaye-Templeman
declined Antonio's protection.  The glance and tone,
however, which softened her words of refusal
suggested to the monk that he was forgiven.
</p>

<p>
"You can't endure my escort," he said, with a ghost
of a smile, "because you still hate me."
</p>

<p>
"I don't hate you," she retorted.  "I never did hate
you&mdash;not you in particular.  For the moment I simply
hated every thing and every place and every body.
It's over now.  Pray believe I don't make such an
exhibition of myself often.  And please forget, if you
can, that I was so weak and silly.  Good-bye.  I will
tell my father you are still at the abbey."
</p>

<p>
Antonio returned to the chapel.  Young Crowberry
was kneeling on the lowest step of the altar, facing the
empty tabernacle.  He rose in confusion and came to
meet the monk.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you had taken her up to the guest-house,"
he said, as they walked out into the cloisters.  "I heard
you both go outside.  I suppose you wasted your
breath.  Isabel Kaye-Templeman will never forgive
you."
</p>

<p>
"The Senhorita has forgiven me already," said
Antonio.  "Or, to be exact, my explanation is accepted."
</p>

<p>
"Then you've some magic power over her," declared
young Crowberry.  "I thought so yesterday, at
dinner.  Now, I am sure of it.  With everybody else
she's as hard as nails."
</p>

<p>
"I imagine that bitter experiences have made her
suspicious and reserved," said Antonio.  "For that I
don't blame her.  But one thing pains me, beyond
words.  I can understand Miss Kaye-Templeman having
prejudices against the Catholic Church; but she
seems equally contemptuous of all religion."
</p>

<p>
"At Sir Percy's house," explained young Crowberry,
"or more strictly speaking, at Sir Percy's
innumerable houses and lodgings, you can depend on
meeting, any Sunday night, half a dozen second-rate men
of science.  They're all anti-Christians and most of
them are blank atheists.  I've heard them talk two or
three times.  Their position seems to be that we know
more than our grandfathers did about the way the
world is made; and, therefore, the world made itself.
They can't argue; or, if they can, they don't.  They
coolly take it for granted that everybody who still
clings to Christianity is an antiquated fool."
</p>

<p>
"You think clearly, Edward, and you talk sensibly.
In a minute I'm going to ask you about yourself,"
said Antonio.  "But tell me.  How far has this poor
Miss Isabel been perverted by what she has heard?"
</p>

<p>
"When she consented to come and live here," Edward
replied, "I heard somebody ask her how she
would get on without an English church.  Isabel
simply answered: 'If I've given up church-going, in
England, why should I begin it again in Portugal?'"
</p>

<p>
They emerged from the building and looked up the
paths; but Sir Percy was not in sight.  Antonio led
his companion back to the spiral stairway; and when
they were seated on the roof of the cloister he drew
forth the truth concerning young Crowberry's state of
mind and soul.
</p>

<p>
From his English journals and reviews the monk
had gathered some imperfect notions of the new
ecclesiastical movement which a scholar of Cambridge had
set going at Oxford.  He knew the names of Pusey
and of Newman, and was conversant with the main
argument of the notorious "Tract Ninety," although
it had issued from the press only a few months before.
But it was from the lips of Edward Crowberry that he
received his first connected account of the matter.
The young man, as Antonio had said, thought clearly
and talked sensibly.  Unlike the leaders of the
movement he was unembarrassed by the need to reconcile
his new findings with his old utterances; and therefore
he saw further than much wiser men into the movement's
future.  Perhaps some of his more striking
sentences had adhered to his mind after the perusal of
books and articles; but he understood what he had
read, and he had made it his own.
</p>

<p>
"Our English skeptics," he said, "have thought to
take away from us our Christianity.  Our Christianity
remains; and we are also regaining the Church.  In
England the very idea of the Church had almost
passed away.  Our bishops had almost ceased to rule
and to teach.  Our sacraments had become mere
commemorations&mdash;like birthdays and anniversaries.  But
the Church is emerging from the mists.  I believe that
in a hundred years from now hardly any Christianity
will be professed save in communion with the Church.
On the one side we shall have the ancient Church,
boldly affirming supernatural religion, proclaiming the
deposit of faith, cherishing her holy mysteries; and,
on the other, we shall have a great band of thinkers
and teachers for whom this world is all.  The
nondescript waverers, betwixt and between, will disappear.
There will be only Isabel Kaye-Templemans and..."
</p>

<p>
"And Edward Crowberrys," said Antonio, coming
to the relief of his modesty.  "You prophesy boldly.
But please make one point still plainer.  What will
this Church be?  I have read something about a Via
Media.  Many of your writers seem to think there
will be three Churches, the Eastern, the Western, and
the English&mdash;Constantinople, Rome, and Canterbury.
They seem to believe that the Church of England can
purge herself of heresy while persisting in schism.
Am I right?"
</p>

<p>
"You are right," said young Crowberry.  "That is
their hope.  But do not judge them harshly.  There
is much in our national Church for us Englishmen to
be proud of.  And there is much in our history, much
in our temperament, which will make our return to the
Roman obedience a bitter pill to swallow.  I know
little of the Eastern Church.  There are hardly any
English books about it.  But what has the East to do
with England?  On the point which divided West and
East, England believes with the West.  No.  The
only Church to which we can return is the Church
from which we broke away."
</p>

<p>
"You are young and sanguine," returned Antonio.
"You will want more than a hundred years before the
English schism is ended.  But I believe that, before
you are middle-aged, you will see thousands of
individuals returning home one by one.  You have told
me that these earnest men in Oxford claim to be
fighting the battle of the Apostolical Succession.  Those
men will soon learn that they are already well
advanced on the road to re-union with the Apostolic
See.  The Church in England was destroyed by
monarchs' commands and by lawyers' pens; but it cannot
be restored, bodily, by similar means.  It will be
rebuilt out of individual converts, like the Churches
founded by the apostles.  It will not be a wholesale,
sudden, man-made event like the conversion of the
Franks after the baptism of Clovis."
</p>

<p>
They sat silent, looking across the sea towards
England, the hidden and beloved isle.  At length
Antonio asked:
</p>

<p>
"Does your father know which way your thoughts
are running?"
</p>

<p>
"My father drinks and swears," young Crowberry
answered.  "But according to his lights he is a
Christian.  It is his teachers' fault, not his own, that he
believes the Pope to be Anti-Christ, or the Man of
Sin, or the Scarlet Woman.  He ceased to read and
think so long ago that his ideas cannot be changed.
What would you have me do?  I say nothing.  I go
my own way.  The same with my friends.  They
think I'm a mere rattle like a few dry peas in a box.
Let them.  I prefer it."
</p>

<p>
"But, sooner or later, you must take the great step
and you must declare it.  What will your father say
then?"
</p>

<p>
"He will say what he always says when I cross
him&mdash;that I shan't have a penny of his money.  If he
were still rich I could stand up and simply say, 'Sir,
keep the money; only pray let me call my soul my
own.'  But I know, and he knows, and each of us
knows the other knows, that there won't be a penny
to leave.  In his old age I must support my father,
and I shall be proud to do it.  But, meanwhile, I can
only hold my tongue."
</p>

<p>
After another long pause the monk said:
</p>

<p>
"One more question.  This young lady Isabel.
You were so eager to know my opinion of her.  Why?
Is there anything between you?"
</p>

<p>
Young Crowberry laughed aloud; and only when
his laughter had subsided through many guffaws and
chucklings could he speak.
</p>

<p>
"Is there anything between me and Isabel?" he
echoed.  "Yes.  There is.  By Jove, there's a good
deal.  There's an iron door.  There's a brick wall.
No, a stone wall&mdash;stone-cold, like a wall of ice.
Anything between us?  There's the whole world; also the
sun, moon, planets, and fixed stars, not to mention a
few comets and the Milky Way."  And he chuckled
again.
</p>

<p>
"Yet you're greatly interested in her," objected Antonio.
</p>

<p>
"No doubt," admitted young Crowberry.  "I'm
inquisitive.  I'm mightily curious to know what there
is behind the iron door, what there is over the brick
wall.  Not that it is reciprocal.  Isabel thinks of me
as a mere infant.  Or, rather, Isabel doesn't think of
me at all.  She can't remember my existence; and I
can't forget hers.  She rubs up my quills the wrong
way; but I can't even prick her fingers."
</p>

<p>
"You know her ten times better than I do," said
Antonio.  "Yet, after our two meetings, I suspect that
you misjudge her.  Any hardness&mdash;and I haven't
found her so hard, after all&mdash;may be her misfortune,
rather than her fault, like her irreligion.  To tell
the truth, Edward, I thought you wanted to marry her."
</p>

<p>
"Marry Isabel?" whistled the young man.  "I
might as well propose to marry Helen or Cleopatra.
By the way, I don't believe that either Helen or
Cleopatra was half so good-looking as Isabel.  She's
younger than either of 'em; but the point is that she's
three years older than poor little Edward.  No.
Fortunately I don't want Isabel.  If I did, it would be a
sad case of unrequited affection."
</p>

<p>
He fixed his eyes once more on the far-spread
waters.  When he spoke again, it was with a solemnity
in strange contrast with his interlude of jesting.
</p>

<p>
"Senhor da Rocha," he said.  "I shall never marry.
For months this has been growing clearer and clearer
to my mind.  For the present I shall stick to my
engineering.  I shall make more in ten years out of
tunnels and embankments than my father has made
in thirty out of barrels and bottles.  And afterwards?
I don't know.  But something is in store for me which
forbids me to marry."
</p>

<p>
His words moved Antonio deeply.  Sixteen years
before, his own vocation had proclaimed itself to his
soul in this very way.  He turned reverent eyes upon
his companion; for had not God chosen this strange
youth to be a priest and perhaps a monk?  In repose
Edward Crowberry's face was not without nobility.
For the first time Antonio thoroughly understood him.
He perceived that Edward's quickness to seize the
humors of life connoted a deep sense of its pathos.
Under the glittering spray of his jests and sarcasms was
an unending undertone of world-woe.  Young Crowberry
saw, better than others, the sharp outlines of
Time's successive moments because their infinitely
varying curves and angles cut brilliant patterns in the
near background of Eternity.
</p>

<p>
An inward voice spoke to Antonio.  It was as clear
as any of the commands which had guided him in the
great crises of his history; and he obeyed it without
parleying.
</p>

<p>
"Let us go down," he said.
</p>

<p>
They went down.  Sir Percy had not arrived.  The
monk walked out and scanned the path.  Nobody was
in sight.
</p>

<p>
"You believe," he said to young Crowberry, as he
re-entered the chapel, "that some work, some sacred
work, is reserved for you in the future?  Are you
willing to do a good work this very night?"
</p>

<p>
"You mean," said the youth, "am I willing to sit up
with you and to disprove that monstrous tale about a
monk's ghost?  I am willing.  I told you so yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"No and Yes," Antonio answered.  "We will
disprove the midnight ghost.  But I mean something
else.  Will you work with me against Sir Percy to
save these azulejos?"
</p>

<p>
Young Crowberry started.
</p>

<p>
"It smacks of disloyalty to your friends, of disobedience
to your father, of deceit all round," Antonio
went on.  "But think.  We cannot serve your friends
and your father better than by frustrating a sacrilege
of which they will be ashamed when the gains are
spent.  Remember, these azulejos are not Sir Percy's.
He has paid to the Government, which stole this place,
hardly more than a tenth of the price, and he has no
right to carry a handful of dust or a chip of stone
outside the gates.  Don't answer me in a hurry.
Refuse if your conscience so bids you, and I shall not
complain."
</p>

<p>
He walked away and sat down in his old stall.
Young Crowberry moved slowly to the white marble
doorpost set in the blue midst of the azulejos and
leaned against it, with his head bowed.  At the end of
five minutes he strode boldly up to the sanctuary rails
and said:
</p>

<p>
"I will help."
</p>

<p>
Footsteps resounded in the cloister, and, a few
seconds later, Mr. Crowberry and Sir Percy appeared,
talking loudly.  They kept their hats on their heads
and their cigars in their mouths.  The baronet, who
carried a glazed jar, was so intent on his operations
that he forgot to greet the monk.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" asked Mr. Crowberry, sidling close to
Antonio.  "You've turned up?  And you've come to
your senses?"
</p>

<p>
"From your point of view, my answer is No," said
the monk.  "I have not come to my senses.  Has Sir
Percy come to his?  Does he still persist in removing
what isn't his own?"
</p>

<p>
"He persists," said Mr. Crowberry.  "And I can't
blame him.  If he doesn't steal the stuff, somebody
else will.  Now take my advice.  Don't be an ass.
Ten minutes ago, up at the house, Sir Percy nearly
blew his daughter's head off for suggesting that the
azulejos should be left alone.  They've got to come
down.  Give him a lift and you can make your own
terms about the lease of the vineyards.  Cross him,
and you will lose the vineyards&mdash;and the azulejos'll
come down all the same."
</p>

<p>
"Hallo, you've come!" bawled out Sir Percy to
Antonio.  "We've been waiting for you all day.
Hurry up and look at my saw."
</p>

<p>
The monk stepped forward.
</p>

<p>
The frame of the circular saw was ingeniously
secured to the face of the azulejos by means of leather
suckers, such as boys play with among cobble-stones.
This simple and portable device served its purpose
without doing the tiles the smallest harm.  The saw
itself had a gear which caused it to descend in the
frame as the teeth cut their way downward.  Mounting
the short ladder at Sir Percy's bidding, Antonio
saw that a groove had been chiseled in the cement and
that it was filled with an evil-smelling mixture of acids.
</p>

<p>
"First, we took off that white stone," explained Sir
Percy, pointing to the marble cornice.  "D'ye see?
Then we cut out this channel.  D'ye see?  Mark the
principle.  The great thing is, not to try and get the
azulejos off the cement, but to get the cement,
azulejos, and all, off the wall.  D'ye see?  It doesn't
matter how rough we are with the front of the wall and
the back of the cement, so long as we don't crack the
tile.  That's the principle.  D'ye see?  Now, pour
in a pint or so of this."
</p>

<p>
"You'll do it better yourself," said Antonio,
descending the ladder.  Sir Percy promptly climbed up
and poured out another acid from his stone jar.
</p>

<p>
"The acids rot the cement," he went on.  "That's
the principle.  They disintegrate it.  You see?  Then
the saw sets to work.  It goes through the cement as
if it's Bath brick.  We shall get down two lots of
azulejos in two places.  That'll give us elbow-room
for cutting through the cement backs of the lot
between with a mason's saw.  You understand&mdash;a long
saw with two handles?  D'ye see?  The acid and the
round saw here and there; and the long saw in
between.  That's the principle."
</p>

<p>
The baronet stared at Antonio, waiting for his
opinion.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" he demanded impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"I am quite unable," said the monk coolly, "to
suggest the smallest improvement in your Excellency's
invention.  But the daylight is failing.  If your
Excellency works by candle-light or lamp-light, some
azulejos will probably be broken.  Let the acids work
all night; and let us all meet here at eight o'clock
to-morrow morning."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense," cried Sir Percy.  "We've time to get
down the first lot."
</p>

<p>
"And what about dinner?" asked Crowberry <i>père</i>, in
great alarm.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Dinner?" echoed Crowberry <i>fils</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Dinner be hanged!" cried Sir Percy angrily.
</p>

<p>
"Your Excellency must give the acids all night to
work," said Antonio.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, your Excellency really must," added young
Crowberry.  "Perhaps your Excellency has forgotten
that the great Carthaginian Hannibal likewise
employed an acid&mdash;namely vinegar&mdash;to make rocks
friable, during his famous crossing of the Alps, as is
narrated by the historian Livy in his twenty-first book.
I know the passage well, having had to copy it out
twenty times at school for putting pepper in the usher's
pipe."
</p>

<p>
"Shut up!" snapped his indignant father.  But the
youth was not abashed.
</p>

<p>
"If Hannibal left his puddles of vinegar out all
night," he said, "I, for one, cannot be a party to your
Excellency's doing differently.  I'm off."
</p>

<p>
He moved away.  Antonio followed.  Mr. Crowberry
senior, glad of any excuse to get back punctually
for dinner, hurried in their train.  Sir Percy gaped
after them in deep disgust.  Then he flung down his
chisel upon the pavement and strode out after the
others.
</p>

<p>
"At eleven o'clock to-night," whispered young
Crowberry in Antonio's ear.
</p>

<p>
"At eight o'clock to-morrow morning," said
Antonio in a loud voice.
</p>

<p>
He went his way and they went theirs.

<h3>
VIII
</h3>

<p>
Had the black monk's ghost attended his vigil in the
abbey chapel young Crowberry could hardly have seen
it.  His labors among the azulejos preoccupied him for
over four hours, and it was within an hour of dawn
when he stole back on tip-toe to his room in the guest-house.
</p>

<p>
As for Antonio, he did not go to bed at all.  After
parting from young Crowberry at the chapel-door,
he hastened straight to wake up José; and as soon as
he had made sure that José understood the part he had
to play, it was time for the monk's morning splash in
the deepest pool of the brook.  After Antonio had
shaved and dressed himself with unusual care, both
master and man sat down to a first breakfast much
ampler than usual; for who could tell what might befall?
</p>

<p>
The monk took care to arrive a few minutes late at
the chapel.  Sir Percy was there already, high on his
ladder.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo," he cried, without wasting breath or time in
saying a Good morning.  "The stuff works.  D'ye
hear?  It works.  We shall cut through the cement
like cheese."
</p>

<p>
"Don't say cheese," pleaded young Crowberry,
appearing in the doorway.  "It makes me hungry.  Say
putty, or chalk, or soft soap."
</p>

<p>
He was swept into the chapel by Mrs. Baxter, who
suddenly filled the doorway like a wave bursting
through an arch on a limestone coast.  Behind
Mrs. Baxter could be heard the loud voice of
Mr. Crowberry.  Antonio advanced to greet the lady and to
express his hope that she was well.
</p>

<p>
"No, Signor Da Rocha, I am not well," responded
Mrs. Baxter tartly.  "Since you asked me, I am very
ill indeed.  But who cares?  I have long ceased to
look for gratitude; but it seems that I must no longer
expect common humanity."
</p>

<p>
"By common humanity, ma'am," said young Crowberry,
"I assume you mean ham and eggs, or possibly
kidneys and bacon.  I too, alas, have looked for them
in vain."
</p>

<p>
"I allude," said Mrs. Baxter severely, "to the fact
that I have been dragged from bed, despite my sick and
suffering condition, without a morsel of breakfast, to
catch my death of cold at an unearthly hour in this
living tomb.  I do not allude, Mr. Edward, to kidneys
and bacon."
</p>

<p>
"What's this about kidneys and bacon?" demanded
Mr. Crowberry, hurrying up with an eagerness which
made him almost sprightly.  "Where?  When?
How on earth have you managed it?"
</p>

<p>
Antonio abandoned the two voluptuaries to the
tender mercies of young Crowberry; for Isabel was
standing in the doorway.  Her walk through the
morning air had painted her cheeks a delicate
rose-pink; but, as she stood among them with white
ungloved hands showing against her blue dress of fine
stuff, and with a large white feather curled round her
blue hat, she seemed like the azulejos, all blue and
white.
</p>

<p>
"So you have come to see the end?" she said.
</p>

<p>
"Who knows?" he retorted, smiling sadly.  "Will
the saw survive the acid?  We shall see.  But I crave
leave to thank you.  You have interceded with your
illustrious father."
</p>

<p>
"I have," she said, "and my illustrious father simply
ordered me off to bed, like a small child.  You don't
understand him.  He has never noticed that I am
grown up into quite an old young woman.  He still
calls Mrs. Baxter my governess.  I believe he thinks
she still gives me lessons in arithmetic and spelling.
I did my best; but it was worse than nothing."
</p>

<p>
"If you had succeeded triumphantly," he answered,
with one of his unconscious glances into the depths of
her eyes, "I could not be more grateful than I am."
</p>

<p>
Young Crowberry came forward and presented his
morning compliments.  He added that Sir Percy had
found a defect in the vertical traveler of his circular
saw and that he wished to be unbothered by onlookers
while he put it right.  The young man went on to
suggest that it might divert that Excellent Creature
Mrs. Baxter from the contemplation of her wrongs if they
showed her round the monastery.
</p>

<p>
Grumbling gruffly at his fate, Mr. Crowberry the
elder joined the party.  Mrs. Baxter composed her
features to an iron immobility.  She was evidently
determined to approve of nothing.
</p>

<p>
"I confess, ma'am," said young Crowberry, "that the
humble entertainment we have to offer is poorer in
excitement than some others; for example, than the
public hangings which are provided for the nobility
and gentry of our own country at this same hour of
eight o'clock."
</p>

<p>
Nobody laughed.
</p>

<p>
"You are standing," the youth rattled on, "in a
monastery, or monasterium.  The word is derived,
ma'am, as you are aware, from <i>monachus</i>, a monk,
and <i>sterium</i>, a sterium.  This passage is called a
corridor, from <i>curro</i>, meaning 'I run,' and <i>dor</i>, a door.
You observe the doors on both sides.  With your
permission, ma'am, we will proceed to the kitchen."
</p>

<p>
The white kitchen was filled with bright sunshine.
The sun's beams came flashing back from the great
hood of burnished copper, and the singing torrent was
quick with glancing lights.  Young Crowberry showed
Mrs. Baxter the long turnspit, turned by a wheel at the
end, and gravely assured her that it was capable of
roasting a pigeon, whole.
</p>

<p>
"What is that word <i>Paz</i>, between the windows?"
asked Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"It is Portuguese for 'Peace,' the watchword of the
Benedictine order," Antonio answered.  "The monks
here were Benedictines."
</p>

<p>
"What were they here for?" Mr. Crowberry demanded.
</p>

<p>
Antonio hesitated.  Then he quietly gave the answer:
</p>

<p>
"To pray, and to praise God."
</p>

<p>
"Praise God, indeed!" cried Mr. Crowberry.  "A
fine way of praising God to stuff and guzzle from one
year's end to another!  I'll tell you what it is, da
Rocha.  You've got your tongue in your cheek.
You're a man with fifty times too much sense to
believe that the Almighty is pleased with the praises of
a greasy pack of gormandizers and soakers.  Thank
goodness your country has turned 'em out."
</p>

<p>
He strode out of the kitchen with all the dignity of
a churchwarden carrying the collection-plate into the
vestry.  The others followed.
</p>

<p>
"What is behind these doors?" demanded Mr. Crowberry.
</p>

<p>
"Cells," said Antonio, curtly.
</p>

<p>
"Cells?"
</p>

<p>
"Why not, sir?" asked young Crowberry, in
honeyed tones.  "Why not cells here as in other
penitential establishments?  All the best prisons have
them.  I thought it was a matter of common knowledge
that the principal occupation of a monk when
he gets into a monastery is to prevent the other monks
getting out."
</p>

<p>
"Shut up!" snapped his father, striding on.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Baxter spoke at last.  She adventured the
point of her shoe and the tip of her nose into
Antonio's cell, which had been left open.
</p>

<p>
"Is this the condemned cell, Mr. Edward?" she
asked with a shudder.
</p>

<p>
"They're all condemned cells, ma'am," Edward
answered.  "Every monk was condemned to penal servitude
for life.  At the end of his term he was taken
out to be hanged, drawn, and quartered.  A few days
after, he was buried alive, or walled up.  If this
didn't cure him of his errors the Abbot began to think
it was really time for something to be done; and he
was sentenced to take a bath."
</p>

<p>
Antonio turned away, grievously wounded.  After
their solemn conversations on the highest and holiest
things, these jests scorched him like hot irons.  But,
upon reflection, he could condone much of young
Crowberry's offense.  Doubtless the youth had a good
motive in plying the edged tool of ridicule against the
prejudices of his companions.  But his main excuse
lay in his inability to take monks seriously.  The
youth did not know that Antonio was himself a monk,
and that this had been Antonio's cell and that
Antonio had spoken to his Lord within it.  He had never
consciously met a monk in his life.  Monks to him
were like mailed knights to a reader of historical
novels; they were merely the picturesque literary
fictions of Mrs. Radcliffe, of Sir Walter Scott, of
"Monk" Lewis.  Or, rather, monks to young
Crowberry were pretty much what exorcists had been to
Antonio.  Although the Church still ordained
exorcists, and exorcists were prayed for every Good
Friday, Antonio had turned more than one light
pleasantry about them.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless the monk could have wished that
young Crowberry had spoken otherwise.  When every
allowance had been made, his irony remained more
mischievous than useful; and Antonio determined to
counteract it.  Turning to Mrs. Baxter he gave her a
rapid sketch of a monk's day.  At the very outset,
when he told her how every monk answered the loud
knock at his cell door before daybreak with "Thanks
be to God!" the Excellent Creature shivered; but, in
spite of herself, she grew interested.  Even Mr. Crowberry
condescended to return and to give the orator his
grudging attention.  But at Isabel Antonio threw only
two furtive glances; for she seemed to be hearing
him with distaste.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," snorted Crowberry <i>père</i>, as the
monk's voice ceased.  "You merely confirm what I've
always said.  For my part I believe that the Almighty
intended us to enjoy the good things of life.  If not,
why did He provide 'em?  Pssh!  Humbug!  D'ye
mean to tell me, sir, that the Almighty's pleased with
all this nonsensical fasting&mdash;with madmen clemming
'emselves till they're like a gang of scarecrows, with
their bones sticking out through their skins?  No, da
Rocha, you don't.  I tell you again that you've got
your tongue in your cheek."
</p>

<p>
"Apparently Mr. da Rocha has his tongue in both
his cheeks at once," put in Crowberry <i>fils</i>.  "I gather,
sir, that these regrettable monks were, at one and the
same time, a gang of bony scarecrows starving
themselves to death and also a pack of fat and greasy
gormandizers and guzzlers.  Such Jesuitical duplicity
makes me shudder."
</p>

<p>
"Come to think of it," blurted out his father, "I
shouldn't be surprised if da Rocha here is a Jesuit
monk in disguise.  Where's his whiskers?  Where's
his wife?  I don't call it natural."
</p>

<p>
"A Jesuit monk?" moaned Mrs. Baxter, recoiling in
horror.  "How dreadful!"  And she grabbed at Isabel's
arm as if to snatch a helpless victim out of danger.
</p>

<p>
"There's no such a thing as a Jesuit monk, madam,"
smiled Antonio.  "The Jesuits are a Society, not a
monastic order."
</p>

<p>
"There are Jesuit nuns, anyhow," muttered Mrs. Baxter,
scowling darkly.  "England is full of them."
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me," exclaimed Antonio, keeping all his
good temper.  "That can hardly be.  There are
women-Benedictines, women-Dominicans, women-Carmelites,
and so on; but there's no such thing as a
woman-Jesuit."
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, too," retorted Mrs. Baxter warmly.
"I am English and I ought to know.  I repeat that
England is full of female Jesuits.  So how can you
stand there, Signor, and say that Jesuits are never
women?"
</p>

<p>
"They are women, of course," interrupted
Mr. Crowberry; "old women.  Silly old women.  Why,
they walk about in petticoats, and nothing pleases 'em
so much as putting on finery and dressing up images,
like little girls dressing up dolls.  Tut!  But come,
da Rocha, out with the truth.  I'll lay you a dozen of
old Madeira against a half a dozen of your new
champagne that you can't swear your Bible oath that you
aren't a Jesuit in disguise."
</p>

<p>
"I won't have the Madeira; but lend me your
pocket Bible," demanded Antonio.
</p>

<p>
"Lay your hand on your heart, instead," Mr. Crowberry
answered.
</p>

<p>
It was plainly necessary to take up the gauntlet
which had been thrown down; so Antonio placed his
hand on his heart, and said:
</p>

<p>
"I swear I am not a Jesuit, either in disguise or out
of it.  I never was a Jesuit; am not now; and never
shall be."
</p>

<p>
"Amen," said Mr. Crowberry, not without traces
of thankfulness and earnestness in his tones; "I'm
glad you're letting me off the old Madeira.  Hallo!
Time's up.  Here's Sir Percy."
</p>

<p>
"D'ye hear?  Am I to wait all day while you stand
there chattering?" Sir Percy bawled out.  And he
strode back into the chapel.
</p>

<p>
Everybody made haste to follow.  But before they
could see whence it proceeded a horrible noise set their
teeth on edge.  It was as though somebody was
creaking a basket-lid near a hive of buzzing bees.
Antonio knew that the saw had begun to revolve.  He
pressed forward and found Sir Percy's gray-headed
stolid man-servant Jackson working a treadle at the
foot of the azulejos.  High above Jackson's head the
saw was grinding round in the acidulated cement.
</p>

<p>
"It works!" cried Sir Percy.  "D'ye hear, all of
you?  D'ye see?  It works!"
</p>

<p>
As the saw's teeth bit and chewed the acrid cud a
fine gritty dust flew up into a sunbeam and glittered
like the spray of a waterfall.  The noise increased,
until it resembled the drawing of a great slate pencil
backwards along a vast slate.  Isabel and Mrs. Baxter
put their fingers in their ears.
</p>

<p>
"It works, it works, it works!" repeated Sir Percy.
His eyes shone.  Antonio glanced at him and shuddered.
One moment he looked like a boy of twenty;
the next, he looked a hundred years old.
</p>

<p>
The saw went on gnawing, gnawing, biting, biting,
screaming, screaming, like an obscene fiend, until the
back of one azulejo seemed to be wholly cut through.
This first azulejo&mdash;a tile about eight inches
long&mdash;formed part of the multi-colored border which framed
the picture of the Saint's pious boyhood.  Antonio
watched it with a white face and a thumping heart.
Suddenly he shouted:
</p>

<p>
"Look out!  Stand clear!"
</p>

<p>
Almost in the same instant the tile leaped forward
and crashed down upon the pavement, smashing up
into four or five pieces.  Mrs. Baxter wailed aloud.
Isabel sprang like a flash to examine the damage, and
the others were soon at her elbows.  They found that
the saw had cut down cleanly to a certain distance;
but the tile had fallen outward before the scission was
complete, and the cement on its lower part had broken
jaggedly from the wall.
</p>

<p>
Sir Percy closed and opened his eyes like a man
dazed.  Isabel moved to his side.  But he recovered
himself swiftly and brushed her away.
</p>

<p>
"What does it matter?" he demanded, in great
wrath and scorn.  "What are you all standing there
like stuck pigs for?  It's the border.  We can mend
it.  What does it matter?  D'ye hear?"
</p>

<p>
He cast a glance at the saw.  It was correctly placed
for cutting down the azulejo which stood below its
fallen neighbor.  Waving Jackson aside he placed his
own foot on the treadle and worked away with feverish
energy.  Hummings, creakings, and screamings
once more filled the holy place.
</p>

<p>
After the onlookers had fallen back a few yards, the
monk found himself close to Isabel.  He did not look
at her, nor she at him; but he felt instinctively that
she was not on his side.  Standing with tense limbs
and straining eyes she seemed to be putting her whole
mind and will towards her father's triumph and
Antonio's defeat.
</p>

<p>
"Take care of your skulls!" sang out young Crowberry.
His light tenor voice rose almost to a scream.
</p>

<p>
Jackson jumped clear; but Sir Percy held his ground
until the second azulejo lay shattered at his feet.  Then
he ceased working the treadle and moved with slow,
short steps into the middle of the nave.  As he did so
the saw, framework and all, plunged after the azulejo
with a tremendous crash.
</p>

<p>
In contrast with the hideous noises which had
preceded it, the silence in the chapel was uncanny.
Mr. Crowberry sat down abruptly on an old black bench.
Mrs. Baxter wiped away real or simulated tears.
Antonio and Isabel, once more side by side, stared at the
ruins of the saw and its gear.  Young Crowberry
leaned glumly against the doorpost.  Jackson
maintained his deaf-mute stolidity.
</p>

<p>
Sir Percy began to walk up and down the nave.
His military rigidity was gone; and instead of standing
as straight as a poplar he bent and crouched like a
thunder-blasted, storm-beaten oak.  Antonio, in his
moment of victory, suddenly caught sight of Sir
Percy's eyes.  They were like the eyes of a long-hunted,
worn-out tiger brought suddenly to bay; and,
at the sight of them, the monk's heart nearly broke
with love and pity.  Involuntarily he took a step or
two towards the stricken man.
</p>

<p>
"Get out of my way!" thundered Sir Percy, blazing
into terrible anger.  "Clear out!"
</p>

<p>
A chisel was lying in his path.  With the toe of his
finely-made boot he dealt it so forcible a kick that the
iron went ringing across the pavement and chipped a
petal from a rose in the lower border of the Saint's
Shipwreck.  As he strode towards Jackson he limped
a little.
</p>

<p>
"So your dead monks have fought for you and
won," said Isabel bitterly, turning round upon
Antonio.
</p>

<p>
"Sir Percy will try again," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"My father never tries again," said she, once more
turning away her face.
</p>

<p>
Just then they heard a sickening cry of pain; and
the monk saw Sir Percy drop heavily from the top of
the short ladder.  Jackson caught him as he fell.  The
luckless baronet had been trying to discover the cause
of his failure and had thrust his hand into a pool of
burning acid.  He sank against Jackson's rock-like
shoulder and swooned away.
</p>

<p>
Antonio instantly took command.  His strong voice
rang through the chapel like a brazen trumpet.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Crowberry," he said, "run to the kitchen.
There are bowls on a dresser.  Bring us water from
the stream at once.  Edward, rush up to the house.
Bring oil and lint&mdash;oil and silk or linen or whatever
you can.  Mrs. Baxter, you will kindly go and
prepare his bed at once."
</p>

<p>
He did not name Isabel; for she was already bending
over her father with such anguish in her blue eyes
that Antonio could hardly bear the sight.  For a
moment he was forced to turn aside.
</p>

<p>
"Take heart," he said softly in her ear, as soon as he
was able to speak.  "We shall bring him round.  For
an hour or two, I fear he will have great pain; but
there is an ointment at my farm which will give him
ease.  Be brave.  Cheer up.  He must not open his
eyes on weeping faces."
</p>

<p>
While Jackson unfastened the prostrate man's collar
and Mr. Crowberry bathed his forehead with cold
water from the torrent, Antonio hurried through the
doorway and sped up the spiral stairs which led to the
roof of the cloister.  But, about six feet from the top,
he pushed open a somber door and entered a long
attic which ran over the ceilings of the monk's cells,
parallel with the north wall of the chapel.
</p>

<p>
In the faint light he made out José faithfully crouching
in the place which had been appointed him.  By
his side lay an old ramrod and a mallet.  In the
mortar between the granite blocks of the wall were the
holes which Antonio and young Crowberry had bored
in the night.  Their measurements were so exact that
José's ramrod had easily struck out the azulejos the
moment he heard the preconcerted signals of "Look
out!" and "Take care of your skulls!"
</p>

<p>
"Did I do right, your Worship, in knocking over
that skriking saw as well?" asked José.
</p>

<p>
"You did right," said Antonio quickly.  "We have
won; and now we must care for the enemy's wounded.
Sir Percy has burned his hand with acid.  Run to the
farm.  Open the green box.  Bring back the yellow
ointment as fast as your legs can carry you."
</p>

<p>
José raced off, hiding ramrod and mallet under his
coat.  Hardly had he vanished before it flashed across
Antonio's mind that some virtue might remain in the
drugs which the Cellarer had left behind four years
before.  He found the cupboard, smashed it open, and
ran back to the chapel with oil, lint, ointment, and a
cordial.
</p>

<p>
When José reappeared he was just in time to take
a hand with Antonio and Jackson in carrying Sir Percy
back to the guest-house.  Young Crowberry had ridden
off for the Navares doctor.  In the baronet's
comfortless room the monk lavished all his leech-craft; and
soon, under the sway of a strong draught, the sufferer
fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
Isabel accompanied Antonio to the door.  He cut
short her thanks, and was hurrying away homeward
after José, when he heard her light step behind him.
She had something to say; but her courage failed her
and she did not say it.
</p>

<p>
"There is something else that I can do?" asked the
monk.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she answered, with a great effort.  "You
can ... you can promise..."
</p>

<p>
"I can promise ... what?"
</p>

<p>
Isabel blushed furiously.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," she said.  "Good-bye."
</p>

<p>
She fled back to the steps.  But he caught her and
seized the white hand which was about to turn the
brass knob.
</p>

<p>
"You shall tell me," he insisted, mastering her with
his velvet eyes.  "I can promise ... what?"
</p>

<p>
"You can promise," she said, looking on the ground,
"that I may see you again."

<h3>
I
</h3>

<p>
A chariot was at the guest-house door when Antonio
called to enquire about Sir Percy's progress.  At the
horses' heads stood Jackson waiting.  Rugs,
portmanteaux, and a brass-clamped trunk had already
been strapped in their places.
</p>

<p>
"H'llo!" sang out young Crowberry's light voice
from the top of the steps.  "You're the very man we
were coming to see.  We were coming to say good-bye."
</p>

<p>
"You and your father?"
</p>

<p>
"I and my father and Sir Percy.  We're off to
Lisbon.  The doctor from Navares was here all
yesterday afternoon.  Seemed rather clever.  He liked
the way you'd dressed the hand; but he doesn't like
Sir Percy's general health, especially his heart.  So
the guv'nor and I are taking him to the chief Lisbon
doctor.  We shall go to Oporto by sea next week&mdash;the
guv'nor and I&mdash;and from there to London."
</p>

<p>
He descended the bottom step; and, after marching
off Antonio by the arm to a spot out of Jackson's
hearing, he added:
</p>

<p>
"Don't get the idea that I repent of helping to save
the azulejos.  We did the right thing.  All the same,
I'm not happy about it.  In a sense we're to blame
for Sir Percy's burnt hand.  Hang it, he's a brick,
after all!  I couldn't stand pain like that.  He doesn't
give a single moan.  But it isn't Sir Percy who upsets
me most.  It's Isabel.  I said she was all head and
no heart.  By Jove, think of it!  No heart!  Yet
she's hardly left his bedside these twenty-four hours.
She waits on him hand and foot; and sometimes
the look in her eyes is just about as much as I can
stand."
</p>

<p>
"This Isabel certainly has a heart," said Antonio.
"If she's unlike other people, it's because she has
more heart, not less.  I hope the Senhorita will not be
fatigued by her journey to Lisbon."
</p>

<p>
"She isn't going."
</p>

<p>
"Not going?  You don't intend to leave these ladies
alone?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  We're leaving them in charge of a friend.
Besides, there'll be Jackson."
</p>

<p>
"The friend is a man?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite.  He's a man from top to toe.  His name
is Francisco Manoel Oliveira da Rocha."
</p>

<p>
Before the monk could reply, they were joined by
Mr. Crowberry, to whom Jackson had announced
Antonio's arrival.
</p>

<p>
"You're welcome, da Rocha," he said heartily.
"This will save us an hour.  We were meaning to call
and see you on our way to Lisbon.  Teddy has told
you the news.  We want you to be as neighborly as
you can to the ladies.  It will only be for eight or nine
days."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be happy to serve the Senhoras," answered
Antonio.
</p>

<p>
"Happy?  So you ought to be.  But you don't look
it.  Come, damn it all, what did you tell me yourself?
The worst of the year's work is over; and you said you
were going to study.  My advice is ... Don't.
Give yourself a rest.  Run up here of an evening for
a bit of music or a game of cribbage."
</p>

<p>
"Or for a quiet pipe and glass with that Excellent
Creature Mrs. Baxter," put in young Edward.
</p>

<p>
"Do the Senhoras approve of this?" asked Antonio.
</p>

<p>
"We didn't ask 'em," Mr. Crowberry answered.
"But never fear.  They'll jump at it."
</p>

<p>
"And Sir Percy?"
</p>

<p>
"He approves of you entirely.  Y' see, da Rocha,
I've been giving you glowing testimonials.  I've said
that if I were the Grand Turk himself I would trust
you with the latch-key of the harem.  I don't doubt
though," added Mr. Crowberry, chuckling and digging
at Antonio's ribs, "that you've been a bit of a dog in
your time.  Eh?  And none the worse for it either.
Still, the point is you're as steady as an old horse,
now.  Besides, supposing you wanted to make love to
Isabel, it would be all the same.  You'd simply get a
frost-bite."
</p>

<p>
"I am entirely at the service of all your
Excellencies," said Antonio, rather stiffly.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," Mr. Crowberry answered.  "But don't be
too much at the service of Mrs. Baxter.  Between
ourselves, she's a selfish, lazy, avaricious old humbug.
She looks the picture of good temper; but don't be
taken in.  Mrs. Baxter boasts that she has stuck to the
Kaye-Templemans through thick and thin; but she's
buttered her own bread thick all the time.  She is a
rich woman&mdash;all out of Sir Percy.  When the ship
begins to sink, Mrs. Baxter'll be the first to rat."
</p>

<p>
"Then how must I treat her?" Antonio asked.
</p>

<p>
"Simply leave her alone.  She'll spend her days in
bed, like a dormouse&mdash;only, dormice don't wake up
every four hours to ask if it isn't feeding-time.  Even
while Sir Percy has been in all this pain, Mrs. Baxter
has had the servants running about after her the same
as usual."
</p>

<p>
"What about Jackson?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he'll sleep all day too.  He'll find a snug
corner and smoke and dose till dinner-time.  But he
doesn't soak.  And, if there's work to do, he'll do it.
Jackson's all right.  But come inside."
</p>

<p>
On the threshold of the large room Isabel met them.
Want of sleep had paled her cheeks and dulled her
eyes; but an unwonted softness of expression made her
more beautiful in the monk's view than ever before.
He could not help feeling glad that she was remaining
behind, and proud that she was to be in his charge.
Isabel led Antonio straight to Sir Percy, who was
sitting in a rocking-chair with his arm in a sling.
</p>

<p>
The baronet was more changed than his daughter.
He looked weak and old; but he was no longer
distraught.  After he had answered Antonio's inquiries
gratefully, he said:
</p>

<p>
"Senhor da Rocha, it is possible I have behaved
towards you with curtness or even with downright
uncouthness.  If so, I ask your pardon most sincerely,
and I beg you to set it all down to my preoccupation
with a scheme which has failed.  My daughter and I
will never forget your kindness.  Indeed, we are about
to presume still further upon it.  You know that I shall
be absent a few days in Lisbon, and we are hoping that
you will be so very good as to come now and then to
this house."
</p>

<p>
It seemed strange to Antonio.  But he reflected that
the English were strange people, and that Sir Percy
was far stranger than most of his compatriots.  Again
he reflected that neither Sir Percy nor Mr. Crowberry,
in spite of their friendliness, regarded him as other
than a simple farmer who would never cease to be
conscious of their differences of station.  Accordingly he
replied:
</p>

<p>
"Far from asking me a service, your Excellency, on
the contrary, is doing me a great honor.  I value it so
much that he may take his journey with an easy mind."
</p>

<p>
Jackson brought in two bottles of tawny port,
bearing the familiar label of Castro and de Mattos.
Healths were drunk all round; and although Sir Percy,
Isabel and Antonio did not drink more than two full
glasses between them, the bottles were quickly emptied.
Farewells were said.  Then Sir Percy was placed in
the carriage, with Crowberry <i>père</i> at his side.
Crowberry <i>fils</i> climbed upon the box, accompanied by the
Portuguese groom, who had come with the party from
Oporto.  At Sir Percy's suggestion, Antonio took the
vacant seat opposite Mr. Crowberry, so that he should
save his legs a mile of the journey home.  Before
entering the carriage, however, the monk turned to
Isabel and enquired:
</p>

<p>
"At what hours will my visits be least unacceptable
to the Senhoras?"
</p>

<p>
"Come up this afternoon," cried Mr. Crowberry,
emphatically.  "It'll be to-day they'll feel loneliest, when
all we noisy nuisances are gone.  To-day and
to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"But you need sleep?" said Antonio to Isabel.  He
intended to express no more than his genuine solicitude;
but his soft eyes met hers with another glance of
unconscious tenderness.  She colored so noticeably
that he made haste to add: "So I will not come until
four o'clock."
</p>

<p>
Standing on tiptoe beside the chariot Isabel gave her
father a single kiss.  It was plain that such outward
marks of affection were not often exchanged between
them, and that the public giving and taking of this one
kiss meant more than a thousand kisses between less
reserved beings.  Even young Crowberry seemed to
notice it, as though he had eyes in his back; for he
cracked a whip, and the chariot lurched on its way.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
At four o'clock Antonio found Mrs. Baxter waiting
in state to receive him.  Although the light blue silk
dress into which she had packed herself for the
occasion made the Excellent Creature look almost as broad
as long, she was not a wholly unpleasing body.  Her
hair, primly parted in the middle, and drawn tightly
over her temples, was still glossy and black.  Her
insistent smile showed white and regular teeth, and the
color in her cheeks gave her a buxom and wholesome
look in odd contrast with her hypochondriac complaints.
She wore a very large oval brooch containing
a lock of hair which, presumably, had pertained to the
lamented Baxter; also gold ear-rings and a fine gold
chain.
</p>

<p>
It soon became evident that Mr. Crowberry had been
descanting upon Antonio's importance; for Mrs. Baxter
was determined to convince the visitor of her own
past greatness.  She monopolized the conversation.
Beginning with an account of a happy girlhood spent
amidst every luxury in a part of England unnamed, she
went on to speak of her rashly romantic marriage with
the dashing ne'er-do-well Baxter; or her universally-envied
beauty as a bride; of her tearing her veil in
church, and of her coming out in a gust of rain to find
a black cat sitting on the vicar's first wife's
gravestone&mdash;three infallible portents of evil.  Next, of the
handsome, but unpractical, Baxter's prompt and
inconsiderate demise; of the un-Christian obduracy of her
flint-hearted father, who would neither forgive nor
finance his headstrong offspring; and of the entirely
diabolical behavior of the surviving Baxters.
</p>

<p>
Up to this point Isabel had sat bending over some
embroidery, with an air of finding all such work
distasteful; but when the Excellent Creature began
putting the finishing touches to her character-sketch of the
late Miss Caroline Sophia Baxter, she got up unostentatiously
and went softly to the window.  Mrs. Baxter
did not mind, but proceeded to praise the admirable
Providence which had suddenly thrown her into the
path of dear Lady Kaye-Templeman.  A hundred
details followed, and Antonio's eye began to rove.
Nor did it rove vainly; for when Mrs. Baxter
explained how she and dear Lady Kaye-Templeman had
grown to be practically two sisters, the monk saw the
slender girl in the window tap the floor impatiently
with her small foot.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, I was with her at the end," said
Mrs. Baxter, mopping away tears.  "How could I have been
anywhere else?  Her last thoughts were of her darling
child.  'Clara,' she said to me, 'promise me that
you will never desert my Isabel.'"
</p>

<p>
The small foot tapped more sharply.
</p>

<p>
"And I never <i>have</i> deserted her," concluded the
Excellent Creature, "although families of the highest
quality and the first respectability have sought to
induce me, by the most tempting offers, to enter their
establishments.  No, Signor, I've never deserted poor
Isabel, and, until she is dead or married, I never will."
</p>

<p>
"There are clouds coming up from the Atlantic,"
said Isabel, turning round abruptly.  "Mrs. Baxter, we
must either lose the pleasure of Mr. da Rocha's
company, or else let him be soaked through."
</p>

<p>
Filled with a deep dread of the dreary half-hour
when, having recited her own history, she must listen
to another's, Mrs. Baxter was relieved to see Antonio
go.  The Iberian flourishes which adorned his parting
compliments completed her satisfaction.  Why had no
one ever spoken so nicely to her in England?  She
shook hands with Antonio, and very graciously pressed
him to come and drink tea as soon as he should be able.
</p>

<p>
Isabel accompanied him to the top of the stone steps.
</p>

<p>
"I'm so sorry," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry?"
</p>

<p>
"About Mrs. Baxter.  No!  Don't say anything insincere.
I know as well as you do that you hated it as
much as I did.  I could put up with the tale when it
was half truth and half white lies.  But it has changed
with every telling until it's nearly all jet-black fibs.
My mother liked her poor friends more than her rich
ones; but Mrs. Baxter was not her friend.  Nor is
Mrs. Baxter's name Clara.  It is plain Jane."
</p>

<p>
Antonio smiled.  "Anyhow, I've got it over," he
said.  "It had to come, some time or other.  But
where are your clouds that are going to drench me
to the skin?"
</p>

<p>
"Over there," answered Isabel, pointing to one tiny
milk-white cirrus adrift in the clear blue lake of
heaven.  "It's as large as a man's hand.  You think
I'm irreligious; but I've read the Bible, and I
remember something about a cloud no bigger than a man's
hand which worked some miracle."
</p>

<p>
"That little cloud delivered Israel from drought
and from famine," said Antonio.
</p>

<p>
"And this little cloud has delivered you from
Mrs. Baxter and from ... me," she retorted.
</p>

<p>
"It is banishing me from you," said Antonio, with
prompt gallantry.
</p>

<p>
"If you wish to see me again&mdash;though I can't think
why you should," she said, in as colorless a tone as she
could command, "don't always come in the afternoon,
or to the house.  Mrs. Baxter will drive you mad.
Come in the morning, to the ravine&mdash;that pretty pool
with the cascade and the stepping-stones.  I shall be
there reading on fine days.  It's a shame to pen you
up in a stuffy house.  Besides, you said it was your
favorite spot.  Mrs. Baxter is calling.  Good-bye."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0502"></a></p>

<h3>
II
</h3>

<p>
When Isabel reached the pool with the stepping-stones
Antonio was already there.  He could have wished
that Miss Kaye-Templeman had not suggested what
might look like surreptitious meetings; but, being a
Portuguese gentleman as well as a monk, he could do
no other than attend her at the place she had appointed.
</p>

<p>
It was a perfect morning.  The sun shone more
hotly and brightly than on many a day of July, making
one thankful for the shade of the trees, and for the
cold spray of the waterfall.  Hundreds of birds were
singing, and a great Japanese medlar scented the air.
Yet, after half an hour or so of uneasy talk on
commonplace topics, the monk turned home again with a
smarting breast.
</p>

<p>
Somehow the lady gave him a feeling that he had
intruded; that he had committed an indelicacy in so
swiftly taking her at her word; and that he was
beginning to bore her.  The afternoon, before, on the
top of the steps, she had seemed sorry to see him go;
but, at the stepping-stones, she seemed rather to regret
his having come.  While her politeness was unexceptionable,
their good-comradeship appeared to be at an end.
</p>

<p>
His failure to retain her favor piqued Antonio.
Like many another monk before him, he had often
found pleasure in the belief that, if need arose, he
could hold his own as a man of the world.  Nor did
the pleasantness of such a belief spring altogether from
sinful pride.  He had sought to hallow God's name
and to hasten the coming of the Kingdom by sacrificing
his share of life's delights and excitements; and he
naturally preferred to think that the world he had
renounced was a world in which he would have
triumphed, and not a world in which he would have
blundered and failed.  The first eventful days which
followed the arrival of all these English people at the
abbey had ministered so subtly to his complacency
that the awakening was all the ruder.  Beneath the
surface of his monkish humility the natural man began
to stir proudly and imperiously towards the regaining
of his dominance.
</p>

<p>
The next day was Sunday.  So as to save the faces
of poor Magarida and her family, Antonio avoided the
ten o'clock crowd and fulfilled his obligation at the
seven o'clock low Mass.  This was the Mass most
favored of the local Saints and Blessed Ones; but
although the cura and the worshipers were full of
quiet devotion the monk found it hard to keep his
thoughts from wandering.  Nearly all the way home
Isabel tripped daintily hither and thither before his
mind's eyes.  He soon decided that he must not present
himself again either at pool or at guest-house for a day
or two; but this resolution only enhanced the dreariness
of his mood.
</p>

<p>
Reaching the farm about nine o'clock he was about
to prepare his lonely breakfast when José appeared
with a letter.  It had been brought, he said, by Sir
Percy's Portuguese servant, whom José proceeded to
denounce as an inquisitive minx and a saucy
chatterbox.  Antonio broke the seal and read:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>Mrs. Baxter presents her compliments to Signor da
Rocha and requests the pleasure of his company
to-morrow (Sunday) afternoon, for tea.  Mrs. B. trusts
that Signor R. reached home yesterday before the
shower.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Saturday Evening.</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Underneath Mrs. Baxter's expansive script the monk
saw a few infinitesimal characters, so minute that in
spite of his keen eyes he was forced to hold them up to
the light.  At first they looked like a wavy and broken
line, about half an inch long; but he deciphered them
at last.  They ran:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>Do come.  I. K-T.</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"For instance," said José indignantly.  "She asked
me point-blank, plump out, whether your Worship is
engaged to be married."
</p>

<p>
Antonio wheeled round so sharply that he almost
let the paper fall.  It took him some moments to
realize that José was not quoting Isabel, but only Isabel's
servant.
</p>

<p>
"I up and asked her, straight off, if she was engaged
to be married herself," continued José.  "And when
she said No, I said, 'With a tongue like that I don't
wonder at it.'  Then she went home."
</p>

<p>
Antonio forced a laugh and turned back to light a
couple of pine-cones on the hearth.  But when José had
set out for church he picked up the note again and read
Isabel's message thrice over.  Only nine letters; yet
they harped and sang around him as if they had been
the Nine Muses, and all his heaviness and dreariness
fled away from their silver voices.
</p>

<p>
Later on, while he was conning his breviary under
the orange-trees, the monk suddenly faced a question.
It came to him as he recited the None psalm <i>Quomodo
dilexi legem</i>, at the words <i>tota die meditatio mea est</i>.
Could he truthfully say that his "meditation all day
long" was still upon God?  He examined his
conscience.
</p>

<p>
The result was not unsatisfactory.  After years of
loneliness his mind surely needed the tonic of
intercourse with minds of its own order.  Mr. Crowberry
and his son had certainly wrecked his plan of autumn
meditation and study; but after all, these two were
associated with the most crowded and stirring months
of Antonio's career, and he could hardly be cool at
their irruption into the quiet life of the farm.  Again,
the affair of the azulejos had distracted him greatly;
but surely God had been the substratum of his long
thinkings, and the firmament overarching them all.  As
for Isabel, he was spending time with her at Sir Percy's
express request.  That he should find delight in her
society was proper and right.  As a da Rocha, whose
ancestors had fought against the Moors to establish
the Portuguese kingdom and against the Spaniards to
restore it, he naturally felt invigorated by his
encounters with a gently bred and high-born damsel.
</p>

<p>
Although he was perfectly honest in all this inward
searching, the monk, nevertheless, failed to push the
probe right home.  Isabel had been confided to his
neighborly good-will, Isabel was intellectual, Isabel
spoke his beloved English, Isabel was an aristocrat, like
himself; therefore Isabel's temporary prominence in
his thoughts was explained.  It did not occur to him
that Isabel was also the prettiest and daintiest girl
he had ever seen, and that this fact might have some
little to do with his interest in her.  But he was not
wholly to blame for the omission.  Barely ten days had
passed since his escape from Margarida, and Antonio
was taking it for fully granted that he was eternally
proof against girls as girls and women as women.
</p>

<p>
When José came in from church the monk translated
Mrs. Baxter's note aloud, and stated that he would
accept the invitation.  He added that he would take
care to pass the chapel, and, if possible, to collect
the pieces of the two broken azulejos.  The two men
sat awhile in the garden smoking their Sunday cigars
and saying little.  José's peace of mind was evidently
not being disturbed by Sir Percy's daughter as it had
been disturbed by Senhor Jorge's.  After his master
had refused a plump, bouncing, rosy-cheeked, black-eyed
heiress, all covered with gold, like Margarida,
José did not fear his accepting a slender, icy, shell-pink,
simply-garbed, unbejeweled stranger like Miss
Kaye-Templeman.  He would almost as soon have believed
that Antonio was in danger of Mrs. Baxter.
</p>

<p>
The monk set out at three o'clock.  Instead of taking
his usual short cut up the bed of the torrent he followed
the road through the great gates and the avenue of
camellias to the monastery.  He tried the door of the
chapel; but it was locked.  Deeply disappointed, he
was turning away when Isabel came in sight,
descending the steep path from the pool.  She greeted
him with more openness and friendliness than ever
before.
</p>

<p>
"I've come to meet you," she added, "to save my
own life.  Whatever happens, don't let Mrs. Baxter
know I wrote that little bit on her letter.  She gave it
to me to seal."
</p>

<p>
"It was wrong of you," said Antonio, with mock
censoriousness.
</p>

<p>
"I know.  Very wrong," she retorted.  "But
Mrs. Baxter began it.  After her Mrs. B. and Signor R.,
surely there had to be a postscript.  But tell me.
Didn't I see you rattling the door of the chapel?"
</p>

<p>
"I hoped it might be unlocked," he said, a little
awkwardly, "and I thought I might take the liberty
of picking up those broken tiles.  Perhaps they could
be patched together and cemented back into their
places."
</p>

<p>
The thought of the azulejos clouded her gaiety, and
she did not dissemble an impatient pout.  Antonio
drew out his old-fashioned silver watch.
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-five minutes past three," he said.  "We are
too early for Mrs. Baxter."
</p>

<p>
"For Mrs. B., you mean," she answered, dismissing
her impatience.  "Very well, Signor R.; let us go and
gather up the fragments."
</p>

<p>
From her embroidered bag she drew out a tiny handkerchief,
a set of ivory tablets, and, last of all, a long
thin key.  The monk recognized it at once.  It was of
old Spanish work, damascened; and Antonio could not
doubt that if the Fazenda official had been a less
ignorant man he would have ordered a cheap duplicate, so
as to keep the original for himself.  Isabel drove it
into the keyhole; and, a moment later, the well-hung
door rolled back on its hinges and the afternoon sun
filled the chapel with warm light.
</p>

<p>
They entered.  Nothing had been touched since the
moment of Sir Percy's accident.  Without a word the
monk stepped forward and began putting together the
broken framework of the saw.  After some hesitation
Isabel joined him.  Kneeling near his side she sorted
out the shattered azulejos and succeeded fairly well in
piecing them together.
</p>

<p>
"What shall we do with them?" she asked.  "We
have no cement.  Besides, I am not sure that my father
won't prefer to put them back himself.  By the way,
don't tell Mrs. Baxter what we've been doing."
</p>

<p>
"Give them to me," Antonio answered.  And,
having transferred them to a short plank, he carried
the pieces off to his own cell and placed them in the
cupboard.  The damage to the two tiles was irreparable;
but he resolved to puzzle out the secret of their
manufacture and to make new ones in their stead.
</p>

<p>
"We can go now, can't we?" begged Isabel, when he
returned to the chapel.  There was a dutiful, almost
daughterly, submissiveness in her manner which cooed
to his pride more softly and winsomely than he
knew.
</p>

<p>
"We can go," he said.  "There will be time to take
the path over the stepping-stones."
</p>

<p>
They relocked the chapel and mounted through the
wood.  Here and there its brown carpet of pine-needles
was tawny with flecks and dapplings of mellow
sunshine.  In a patch of old garden, round an image of
Saint Scholastica, they found autumn snowdrops,
saffron, and sweet-smelling ranunculus.  Overhead a blue
gum-tree was in full flower, and all the while the wood
hummed and thrilled with the diapason of the hidden
torrent.
</p>

<p>
After they had crossed the stepping-stones Isabel
halted, as if to absorb the loveliness of the rippling
pool.  Antonio remained silent, awaiting her good
pleasure.  Suddenly she said, without turning her eyes
towards his:
</p>

<p>
"This is the place where I was so disagreeable
yesterday morning."
</p>

<p>
He was too much surprised to reply.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it?" she demanded.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Antonio.  "It is the place, where,
yesterday morning, we ... where we didn't get on
together as well as before."
</p>

<p>
"It was all my fault," she persisted.  "I had a silly
fit of prudishness, like a young miss just home from
school.  All the time we were trying to talk I was
wondering what you thought of me for asking you to meet
me alone in a wood."
</p>

<p>
"English ways are different from Portuguese,"
suggested Antonio.
</p>

<p>
"Not so very different, after all," she said.  "Ask
Mrs. Baxter.  Or, rather, take care that you don't say
half a word to Mrs. Baxter about it.  If you do she
will swoon away with horror at the news of my brazen
forwardness."
</p>

<p>
"If you will lend me your little ivory tablets," replied
Antonio, "I shall be able to begin making notes of all
the things I am not to mention before Mrs. Baxter."
</p>

<p>
"Be serious for a minute," she urged with a heightening
of color.  "Unless I can make you understand,
we must not meet this way any more.  If we mustn't,
if we can't, I don't expect it will matter very much to
you; but ... it will to me."
</p>

<p>
Her eyes met Antonio's.  This time it was he who
colored up and fell into confusion.  The only reply he
could think of was a stilted compliment.
</p>

<p>
"The Senhorita does me a great and an undeserved
honor," he stammered.
</p>

<p>
"Don't," she commanded, with an impatient gesture.
"When you talk like that I hate you.  Be sincere.
Besides, I'm not a Senhorita.  If I were a Senhorita I
should have jet-black hair and big sentimental eyes, and
I should never walk more than a mile in my life, and I
should no more dream of meeting you like this than of
dancing on a boa-constrictor.  Are you going to talk
like that any more?  If so, we'll go home this minute
and you can do it on the way."
</p>

<p>
Antonio had met his match.  If Isabel had been a
man he could have met imperiousness with imperiousness,
sarcasm with sarcasm, demand with demand, until
he had established his will.  But Isabel mastered him.
He could only stand before her, like a refined and
handsome José, awaiting orders.
</p>

<p>
"What you must understand is this," she said.
"You have promised to come and talk to me now and
then, while my father is in Lisbon.  You've promised,
and I want you to do it.  I must talk to somebody
sometimes, mustn't I?  But I'd rather not have you
at all than have any more times like Friday afternoon
with Mrs. Baxter.  You may think that, because she
finished the story of her life on Friday, you've got
the worst of it over; but you haven't.  You've still
to hear about the dear Marchioness of Witheringfield.
Mrs. Baxter didn't know the dear Marchioness from
Eve; but the tale will take an hour, all the same.  Also,
you've to hear how Mrs. Baxter lost the Baxter jewels,
which she never possessed; and how she undermined
her health nursing me through a month's fever, though
it was really only a two-days' cold in the head; and how
she rescued the little Viscount Datton from a burning
house, which she never saw in her life.  Don't think
me spiteful.  I simply can't stand it.  Of course, you
must put up with Mrs. Baxter once in a while; but,
speaking generally, if you're coming any more to talk
to me, I want you to talk to me here, at this pool, in
the mornings."
</p>

<p>
"If I come here, to this pool, in the mornings," asked
Antonio, who had recovered himself, "how do you
know that I shan't inflict on you a string of histories
as long as Mrs. Baxter's?"
</p>

<p>
Although he did not mean to fish for a compliment,
his ears expected some pleasing reply; and he was a
little crestfallen when she replied brusquely:
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you will.  Only don't you see, they will be
histories I haven't heard fifty times already.  Come
to-morrow morning.  Now we ought to be going.  It
must be close on four o'clock."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
III
</h3>

<p>
The next morning Isabel and Antonio conversed, to
the accompaniment of the cascade's deep music, for
nearly an hour.  The morning following, their talk
lasted eighty minutes.  On the Wednesday Antonio
again drank tea with Mrs. Baxter, who regaled him
with the full story of the little Viscount Datton's
escape from the blaze at Datton Towers; of his
lordship's ingratitude and eventual marriage; and of the
young Viscountess Datton's scandalous callousness
when her consort broke his collar-bone in a
steeple-chase.  On the Friday morning the monk met Isabel
again at the pool.  Business took him to Villa Branca
on the Saturday; but Sunday afternoon saw him
striding over the stepping-stones once more.
</p>

<p>
Although these sunny hours were seasons of delight
and refreshment to Antonio's human spirit, they did
not parch the springs of his Christly life.  Every night
he continued the pious practice of self-examination;
and he was able, in all honesty and reverence, to justify
himself by the example of his Lord.  <i>Diligebat Jesus
Martham et sororem ejus Mariam</i>, "Jesus loved
Martha and her sister Mary;" and, on the eve of His
passion he fortified His weary spirit for the last
conflict by abiding quietly in Martha's and Mary's house.
And, in this sense&mdash;<i>diligebat not amabat</i>&mdash;Antonio
loved Isabel.  He was drawn to her by silken cords
of pity for a loneliness and lovelessness far worse than
his own.  He loved, with a fine spiritual sympathy
unwarped by earthly passion, the brave, truthful
ardent soul underneath the ice of her pride.  No doubt
he found a sensuous pleasure in the softness of her
voice, in her ever-varying beauty, and in her
never-failing grace; but these charms delighted him by
reason of an exquisite fitness, like the fitness of richly
embroidered vestments and pure golden chalices or
monstrances in great acts of spiritual worship.  He
loved her with a sacred and not with a profane love.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, the monk knew that he was only a
weak mortal, and that he had drifted into a situation
rife with perils.  He remembered that better
Christians than he had made shipwreck of their faith
through yielding themselves too confidently to feminine
companionship.  He recalled the solemn warning of
Saint Paul: "Let him that thinketh he standeth take
heed lest he fall."  But, so far as his own safety was
concerned, a single consideration sufficed to reassure
him.  In a few days Sir Percy would return, and it
was almost certain that he would bid his women-folk
pack their chattels and depart before the second
instalment of purchase-money fell due.  Within a
month, perhaps within a week, Isabel would pass out
of Antonio's life.  Once more he would have to
settle down with José to their dull and lonesome grind,
and probably years would drag away before he could
hear an English voice again.
</p>

<p>
Antonio, however, was not selfish enough to think
only of his own salvation and perfection.  The situation
had its perils for Isabel as well as for himself;
and therefore he followed up his monk's self-examination
by meditating, as a man of the world, on Isabel's
interests.  Although he would miss her sorely,
Antonio was prepared to surrender her, when the time
came, without a murmur, as he had learned to
surrender many lesser delights before; but was Isabel
equally able and willing to surrender Antonio?  She
was young, she was lonely, she was deeply affectionate
as only a reserved woman can be; so was he doing
right in occupying her thoughts more and more?
After striving to act like the very soul of honor
towards the slow-witted and shallow Margarida, was
he not in danger of behaving dishonorably towards
this finely-tempered, deep-hearted lady?
</p>

<p>
These questions suddenly pressed themselves upon
his conscience with so much ardor as he was crossing
the stepping-stones on the second Sunday afternoon
that he halted in the midst of the spray from the
cascade and almost resolved to turn back.  But he
decided that there was no cause for alarm.  In Isabel's
view the difference in their stations must surely repress
any rash outgoings of her maiden fancy.  The da
Rochas could boast a longer and a less dubitable
pedigree than the Kaye-Templemans; but Antonio had
perceived among the English a disrespect for all
aristocracies save their own.  Besides, Isabel knew
not a leaf or a twig of his family tree.  To her he was
a self-made man, a yeoman working with his own
hands.  Educated, traveled, interesting, ambitious,
refined he might be; but, in the social scale, he was
still a yeoman before the eyes of Isabel.
</p>

<p>
No.  Surely there was no peril, no need to turn
back.  At not one of their meetings by the pool-side
had there been the slightest approach to sentimental
interchanges.  They had talked of a hundred matters.
Portuguese, English, and universal, and Isabel had
gone so far as to tell a score or two of intimate
experiences from which Antonio could rebuild the gray
history of her unpeaceful life.  But there had been
no more personal explanations, no more half-quarrels,
no more uncontrolled glances or blushes, no more of
anything outside the frank good-fellowship of fast
friends in the first flush of friendship.  So Antonio
did not turn back.
</p>

<p>
Isabel appeared at last, holding out some papers.
A post had arrived from Lisbon, bringing the news
that Sir Percy was much better.  As the burnt hand
was still useless, Mr. Crowberry had written out the
bulletin; and, enclosed with his letter to Isabel were
two for Antonio.  The first, from Crowberry <i>père</i>,
contained little more than compliments and thanks;
but the second, in the loose handwriting of Crowberry
<i>fils</i>, was more interesting.  It ran:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>Dear Joligoodfellow.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>IhopethiswillfindyouwellasitleavesmeatpresentthankGodforit.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Now that the alujezos (or ajuzelos, or azelujos) are
safe, isn't it time you took a holiday?  Why not come
back to England with Sir Percy and Isabel?  I don't
expect they'll stay in Portugal.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>I will bet a guinea that you've either quarreled with
Isabel or that you haven't.  When you write, don't
forget to say what you really think of her.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Give my love to that Excellent Creature Mrs. Baxter.
Also to the Baxter jewels.  Also to those
monsters of ingratitude, inhumanity, and impiety Miss
Sophia Baxter and the Viscount and Viscountess
Datton.  Also, if you dare, to Isabel.  And accept the
same yourself from</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Your most respectful and obedient</i>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TEDDY CROWBERRY.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It occurred to Antonio that in neither of the letters
was a date given for Sir Percy's return to the
guest-house.  He was on the point of asking Isabel whether
it was mentioned in Mr. Crowberry's bulletin; but he
saw that the question could be interpreted in an
uncouth sense, and therefore he did not put it.  The
answer, however, was writ plain in Isabel's face.  He
swiftly analyzed her cheerfulness into two principal
components&mdash;her thankfulness for Sir Percy's improved
health and her relief at the prolongation of her
liberty.  Isabel's laugh was more free and gay.  She
seemed to be more of a girl and less of a woman.
Indeed, for a few minutes, she became almost a child.
For a while she stood hurling stones into the heart of
the waterfall, as into the white down and iridescent
feathers of a great bird's breast; and as soon as she
wearied of this exercise she began to sail boats of
cork-bark down the hurrying waters of the pool, scolding
or encouraging her favorite as if it had been alive.
</p>

<p>
When Isabel at last sat down she demanded, with her
usual abruptness:
</p>

<p>
"Why have you never told me about the Portuguese
ladies&mdash;about the senhoritas?  I'm tired of Dom
Miguel and Dom Pedro, and Affonso Henriques and
the Cardinal-King.  As for growing grapes, by this
time I know as much about it as you do.  Talk to me
about the senhoritas."
</p>

<p>
"What can I say about them," objected Antonio,
"except that they are exceedingly beautiful,
exceedingly virtuous, and exceedingly charming."
</p>

<p>
"And exceedingly dull," she said.  "But be serious.
Answer me.  Is it true that Portuguese men are only
half Christians?  Is it true that, where women are
concerned, you are out-and-out Moors?  Don't you
all look on women either as toys or as slaves?"
</p>

<p>
"If young Mr. Crowberry were here," retorted
Antonio, "he would tell you how we tie up the ladies
of our harems in sacks and drop them into the Tagus."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad young Mr. Crowberry is hundreds of
miles away," she declared.  "When I've the patience
to listen to him, I admit some of his satire is clever.
But he bores me.  I mean, he annoys me.  I suppose
it's because we've both got yellow hair."
</p>

<p>
"You have not got yellow hair," said Antonio.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind what sort of hair I've got.  Tell me
about the senhoritas.  How do they spend their time?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps they could answer themselves&mdash;though I
doubt it," he said.  "People say they eat and drink
and sleep; they dress and go to church; and, the rest
of the time, they look out of the window."
</p>

<p>
"Is it still true," she asked, "that their ... their
suitors come and stand under the windows at
night, for hours at a time, with guitars?"
</p>

<p>
"Not always with guitars," explained Antonio,
"but the rest is still true.  If you want a senhorita
you must stand under her window, night after night,
for months, wet or fine.  When her window is on the
third floor you get a crick in the neck."
</p>

<p>
"But what do they talk about?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing.  They make eyes."
</p>

<p>
Her questions ceased, and the monk hoped that they
were finished with a risky topic.  Suddenly, however,
she turned upon him and blurted out:
</p>

<p>
"Do you have to crick your neck for Margarida?"
</p>

<p>
Antonio jumped.  The question struck him entirely
dumb.  Margarida!  At first he could only stare at
the questioner blankly.  Then his stung pride made
itself felt.  The blank stare gave place to a flash of
indignation.  Her eyes quailed before the angry fires
in his.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said, slowly and coldly.  "I do not have
to crick my neck for Margarida."
</p>

<p>
Isabel's face showed that she was troubled and
almost frightened at what she had done.  But he made
no haste to condone her offense.  He was capable of
forgiving the injury almost as soon as it was
committed; but he could not so easily surmount his
disappointment at hearing anything like indelicacy from her
lips.  Graver still was this sudden revelation that
Isabel did, after all, think thoughts of him as a lover
and a marrying man.  And it gradually dawned upon
him that there had been something nervous in her
gaiety from the moment of her bringing the
Crowberry's letters.  He understood at last that she had
come determined to probe him with her sudden
question.
</p>

<p>
He got up and moved away a few yards to a point
from which he could see the Atlantic; and there he
stood, taking scrupulous counsel with himself.  Was
it or was it not his duty to make a fresh draft upon
the candor with which he had ended the match-making
of Senhor Jorge?  No.  It was not.  Yet something
had to be done.  What hint ought he to drop,
or what counter-stroke ought he to deliver?  For one
foolish half-moment he almost entertained a mean
plan of letting Isabel believe that there was indeed
something between himself and Margarida.
</p>

<p>
"I am so sorry," murmured a soft and penitent
voice almost in his ear.
</p>

<p>
After long indecision he asked, in dry tones and
without turning to look at her:
</p>

<p>
"What made you say it?"
</p>

<p>
Her pause was longer than his.  At length she answered:
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't idle curiosity."
</p>

<p>
"Then what was it?"
</p>

<p>
"I hardly know.  Only it ... It seemed so
dreadful."
</p>

<p>
"Dreadful?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean," she explained hastily, "it would be dreadful
if you made a marriage like that.  To say so is
unpardonable impertinence on my part, no doubt.  But,
to be perfectly frank, I ... well, I suppose I've
idealized you a little.  You're not like other people
I've met.  And it shocked me to think of you settling
down and, so to speak, giving up the fight."
</p>

<p>
"What fight?" asked the monk, not willing to help
her out.
</p>

<p>
"Fight is the wrong word.  Never mind.  You
know what I mean.  Of course, this Margarida is
good and domesticated and she'll make some farmer
or tradesman an excellent wife.  But can she read or
write?  Has she more than three ideas in her head?
Could she talk with you, or understand you, or even
sympathize with you, in anything that matters?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose she could," said Antonio.  "The simple
things of life are the things that matter."
</p>

<p>
"To simple people, certainly.  But you are not
simple.  You are complicated.  Your teeth are easily
set on edge.  You are sentimental, romantic."
</p>

<p>
"I am sentimental?  I am romantic?" he echoed,
with an unfree incredulous laugh.  "You are the first
to find it out."
</p>

<p>
"It's true, all the same.  What about that shut-up
dismal monastery down there?  Haven't you woven
more romance around it than any ladye ever wove
around her dead knight?  What about the azulejos?
Aren't you you as sentimental over them as any
love-sick youth over a withered rose or a lock of hair?
Why, you were ready to quarrel with us all, your old
friends included, for the sake of a sentimental
memory."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me," the monk demanded, turning to read her
eyes, "what do you know about Margarida?  What
have you heard?  Who has been talking to you?"
</p>

<p>
She was silent.
</p>

<p>
"From whom have you heard Margarida's name?"
he insisted.
</p>

<p>
"You will think very badly of me," she confessed.
"I heard it from Fisher, my maid.  Oh, yes! look
scandalized by all means.  I don't care.  The poor
girl is in exile.  Joanninha, our Portuguese cook,
doesn't know much English, and she's old enough to
be Fisher's mother.  Mrs. Baxter never speaks to
Fisher except to scold her or order her about.  If I
didn't let her chatter now and again to me, she'd go
mad.  Not that I listen to half she says; but I should
be telling you a downright lie if I pretended that I
didn't prick up my ears when she began about you
and Margarida."
</p>

<p>
"What did she say?"
</p>

<p>
"Very little.  Only that Joanninha had been gossiping
in the village shop, and that somebody had said
something about the Senhor Oliveira da Rocha
marrying this Margarida."
</p>

<p>
Antonio relapsed into moody silence.  The news
that his name was still being linked with Margarida's
filled him with chagrin, if only for the sake of Senhor
Jorge and his family.  When, however, his thoughts
came back to Isabel he softened.  He saw no reason
for doubting that she was disinterested in dreading
the disaster of his union with an unlettered and
unintelligent country lass, and he was unconsciously
flattered by her generous recognition of his finer
temperament.  Isabel, waiting at his elbow like a
repentant child, felt the softening; and, plucking up fresh
courage, she said:
</p>

<p>
"You haven't told me yet if it is true.  You've
only told me that you don't crick your neck."
</p>

<p>
"Which do you think?" asked the monk rather
sharply.  "Do you believe this gossip or not?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't," she replied, without hesitation.  "But
... there's just one thing that might make me
credit it."
</p>

<p>
"What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Well.  This Margarida is certainly very pretty.
She has an adorable color and wonderful eyes, and she
wears her mantilla beautifully.  Besides&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But you've never seen her," interrupted Antonio in
alarm.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I have.  This morning.  In church.  At
Mass.  Why weren't you there?  I thought you were
obliged to go.  I went with Joanninha.  Don't ask
me to say that I liked it.  The gilded wood and the
crude colors hurt my eyes, and the music was fearful.
I couldn't understand a word of the sermon and I
didn't know what they were doing at the altar, so I
had to pass the time looking at Margarida.  If I were
a man, I could fall in love with her."
</p>

<p>
"You went to church?" repeated Antonio,
bewildered.  Throughout their many talks during the
week he had avoided the subject of religion.  He had
seen that it ruffled her, and he preferred not to discuss
it until they knew one another's first principles and
prejudices in less weighty matters.  But he had not
once failed, night or morning, to commend the work
of Isabel's conversion to Our Lady of Perpetual
Succor, or to pray that he might become the
instrument of the Holy Ghost therein.
</p>

<p>
"Why did you go?" he asked.  "To look at Margarida?'
</p>

<p>
"Most decidedly not," she retorted with spirit.  "I
didn't know who the pretty girl in the mantilla was
till I came home.  Fisher only told me this gossip two
hours ago."
</p>

<p>
"Then you went to church to see what it was like?"
he persisted, hoping, nevertheless, that there was some
better reason.
</p>

<p>
"I went because I wanted to," she answered.  "But
come back to the point.  Is it true about Margarida?"
</p>

<p>
He had gradually become aware of a new sympathy
between them.  All the resentment and distrust faded
out of his heart.  His gaze sought hers; and not until
he could look down into her eyes did he answer:
</p>

<p>
"It is not true.  It never was.  It never will be."
</p>

<p>
The last syllable had hardly sped clear of his lips
when the monk was struck dumb by the truth.  It
flashed from Isabel's radiant eyes like a flaming sword
into his heart.  A moment later she had turned away
her face; but she could not hide the magic roses, the
great crimson roses, which sprang to full bloom upon
her cheeks.  He knew her secret; and she knew that it
was known.
</p>

<p>
To cover her trouble and confusion, she moved to
find her little gloves and the embroidered bag.
Antonio stooped down before her and was the first to pick
them up; but she snatched them almost roughly out
of his hand.
</p>

<p>
"We've stayed too long," she said.  "I must go."
</p>

<p>
In a twinkling she had crossed the stepping-stones
and was in full flight for home.  No wood-nymph
pursued by a god of old ever flew with more gazelle-like
grace; and the ravine seemed shorn of nearly all
its beauty when the trees hid her from Antonio's
eyes.
</p>

<h3>
IV
</h3>

<p>
On Monday morning, although he had business in
Navares, Antonio was early at the pool.  Throughout
a sleepless night his moods had wavered from
bitter self-reproach to laborious self-justification.
But, amidst all the waverings, one decision stood firm.
He must see Isabel at once.  He must not run away.
He must not tolerate, either on his part or on hers,
any spurious delicacy, any eluding of a thorough
understanding.
</p>

<p>
Try as he would Antonio could not wholly close his
eyes to the grim humor of the situation.  Within the
narrow space of three weeks two young and handsome
heiresses had thrown themselves at his, a monk of
Saint Benedict's, head.  But, while this oddity brought
a bitter smile to his lips, he was not able to take
pleasure or pride in events which were bringing pain
and humiliation to others.  The feeling uppermost in
his heart was one of shame and sorrow for his indiscretion
and weakness in meeting Isabel so secretly and
so often.
</p>

<p>
About half-past ten she came, looking pale and
rather frail.  But she had nerved herself for the
ordeal before her, and she was calm and self-controlled.
</p>

<p>
"I knew you would come," she said quietly.  "Yet
I feared you wouldn't.  Early this morning I nearly
sent Jackson down to the farm with a note; but I
didn't want people to talk."
</p>

<p>
"I came nearly an hour ago," the monk replied.
His tones were so grave and his manner so solemn
that a flush of resentment rose to her cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Don't make things worse than they are," she cried
angrily.  "Aren't they difficult enough already?
You won't help matters by looking and speaking as
if you've come to a funeral."
</p>

<p>
Antonio could not retort that he was indeed standing
by a graveside and that he had come to drop a farewell
tear upon their dead happiness.  He waited for
her next words.
</p>

<p>
"We're obliged to talk out our talk whether we like
it or not," she continued, turning her back upon him
and tearing at the fronds of a young mimosa.  "I'm
not an actress.  I can't pretend that I don't know what
we both know perfectly well.  You can; but I can't.
If I left it all to you, I suppose you'd tell me some
more about the Emperor Pedro, or about sea-sand
grapes.  You'd be perfectly polite and, as you
imagine, perfectly considerate; and you'd go back to
the farm at twelve o'clock."
</p>

<p>
"I came here," answered Antonio, "expressly to
talk and to listen without a moment's false delicacy or
a shade of pretense."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," she said, with a tinge of irony.
</p>

<p>
Her slender white fingers were still wantonly busy
with the mimosa.  The monk racked his wits
desperately for an opening sentence.  He would have
preferred the easier task of facing Senhor Jorge and
Donna Perpetua and Sir Percy and Mrs. Baxter and
the Visconde de Ponte Quebrada and Queen Victoria's
Comptroller and the Fazenda official all combined.
Words refused to come.  But it fell out that his
dumbness was all for the best.
</p>

<p>
"Listen," said Isabel, without turning around.
"You don't expect me to find this interview very
delightful, do you?  You'll admit that it's easier for
me to talk about usurpers and bunches of grapes than
about ... than about all this.  I'll tell you
what I've done.  Perhaps I've done wrong, as usual;
but I can't help it.  I'm going to give you a letter&mdash;I
mean a paper, a scribble.  Some things are so much
easier to write than to say.  After I've given it to
you I'm going away for a walk.  I shall come back in
half an hour.  You may open my little bag.  It is in
there."
</p>

<p>
Antonio loosened the cords of the silken pouch with
respectful hands.  It contained the damascened key
of the chapel, a tiny lump of shining felspar picked up
from the path, a pair of fine gloves, two or three small
coins, and a folded paper.  As he drew the paper
forth, a snapping of twigs made him look up.  Isabel
was breaking her way through the trees.
</p>

<p>
His hand trembled as he unfolded the document.
It was a quarto sheet filled from top to bottom with
Isabel's fine writing.  The monk glanced down the hill
to make sure that she had come to no harm; and as
soon as he caught sight of her walking quickly along
one of the woodland paths, he sat down on a warm
boulder and began to read these lines:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>Four years ago you and Mr. Austin Crowberry
visited the Earl of Oakland.  You dined at Castle
Oakland, and stayed all the next day.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>The Countess of Oakland is my aunt.  I hardly
ever see her, because my father quarreled with the Earl
nearly twenty years ago.  But the Earl has a niece,
Lady Julia Blighe, whom I met in London a few days
after you went away.  Perhaps you remember her.
She is a little over-magnificent, and wears too much
jewelry at once; but people go mad over her, and some
say she is the most beautiful woman in England.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>You made a most extraordinary impression on Lady
Julia.  She admitted giving you a flower.  I grew
tired of hearing about you&mdash;nearly bored to death.
At first she caused me to picture you as a beautiful
Byronic hero, with a Great Grief or a Dark Secret; and
I detest all that sort of trash and gush.  But one day,
while she was chattering, a miracle happened.  I can't
describe it.  Perhaps it was like someone throwing
wide a door that had always been shut, or setting free
a bird or animal that had always been caged.  All in
one moment you became the most important fact in the
world.  Why?  How?  I don't know.  I thought I
knew you through and through.  Often I could have
said to Lady Julia: "No.  That's all wrong.  You
know nothing about him."</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>I can't explain it.  I am simply telling you the fact.
From that time you haunted me.  I became absolutely
certain that our lives, some day, would meet; more
certain than I am of the sun's existence and the moon's.
When Mr. Crowberry told me of the plan for buying
this place, and my becoming your neighbor out in these
wilds, I ought to have been overwhelmed by the
astonishing coincidence; but it seemed as natural and
inevitable as the sunrise.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>At the first moment&mdash;no, not the first&mdash;I mean, the
second moment of our meeting at your farm, I was
mortified because you tried to look at me before I could
look at you.  Why did you do it?  It was unkind.
I had been thinking of you for four years; but you, if
you thought of me at all, couldn't have thought of me
more than four days.  Yet, although you were in such
a hurry to beat off my eyes, I saw in an instant that
you were exactly as I had imagined you.  Oporto and
the Douro were not in the least like the engravings
they showed me in England: but you were my dream
come true.  And all the time I sat on your right hand
at dinner, I felt as if I had known you for years and
years.  You are not as clever as I expected; but you
are gentle, and I am not one bit afraid of you.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>We nearly quarreled about monks and about the
azulejos, did we not?  Still, it was only on the
surface.  You think I make too little of religion; I think
you make too much: but we have agreed quite amicably
to differ.  Deep down in our hearts we are at one.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Since the day my father went to Lisbon I have been
happy, for the first time in my life.  You left me to
make all the approaches; but I was very, very happy
until Fisher mentioned Margarida.  Last night I
ached and burned with shame, because I had let fall
the veil from my heart.  But this morning I am glad
and thankful.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>You are not like other men.  And I think I am not
wholly like other women.  As soon as you have read
this paper we are going to tear it into thousands of
pieces.  So I will be bold.  Mine is not the only secret
that is out.  I know you love me, my friend, my only
friend in the world.</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Antonio paused in his reading.  For a moment he
felt an immense relief at learning that he was not to
blame.  But he reminded himself that his blamelessness
did not help Isabel one whit.  Here was a mystical
passion, an inscrutable supernatural love.  No one
could explain its beginning, no one could foretell its
end.  Only by a great effort did he resume the reading
of the paper.  It continued:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>So much for the past.  Now for the present and
the future.  What are we to do?  Don't be hurt,
dearest friend, if I write bluntly about practical
matters.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>There is a difference in our stations.  I suspect that
your blood is really nobler than mine and that your
escutcheon is less tarnished; but, from the point of view
of my friends, this will be a misalliance.  Don't be
angry.  I mention it only to bid you disregard it.  I
have pondered it well and it weighs less than a sparrow's
feather.  I am nothing to the people in England;
and they shall be nothing to me.  Tell me, though;
was it this that held you back from wooing me?  I
believe it was; and that is why the advances came from
my side.  But, after this, remember!  You must
court me, woo me.  If I command it, you must crick
your neck for me, as if I were a Senhorita.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>And now about my father.  You may fear that it
will be a blow to him.  Certainly it will amaze him
and disconcert him.  But if you were not in the case,
my friend, I should have to amaze him and disconcert
him some other way.  So long as I and Mrs. Baxter
and Jackson are with him, he doesn't realise the flight
of time.  He thinks of me as a little girl, and of
himself as a man of forty who must needs be up and doing.
He has fought his hard fight and he deserves his rest.
More.  He needs it.  The Navares doctor says he will
go out like a candle in a gale if he does not surrender.
Whatever you may think, I love my father; and, even
for your sake, I would not leave his side if it were not
wholly for his good.  God knows I am honest in this
and in every word I have written.</i>  ISABEL.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Mechanically refolding the sheet, Antonio rose to his
feet and drew a deep breath.  In a few minutes Isabel
would return.  She would steal as shyly as a young
deer through the branches.  She would expect him to
spring towards her, to clasp her in his arms, to murmur
proud words of possession, to lavish in her ears his
long-hoarded treasure of love-words, to press kisses
on her hands, her cheeks, her eyes, her hair.  Like a
terrifying tocsin her words clanged in his brain:
"My friend, my only friend in the world, you love me!"
</p>

<p>
He turned his gaze towards the Atlantic.  But the
day was growing sultry.  Thunder was in the air and
mists hid the great waters.  He dared not look into
the woods lest he should espy the slender figure tripping
towards him.  And somehow he could not lift up his
eyes and his heart to heaven.  In this cruel issue his
inborn instincts of a courtly gentleman wore down his
acquired habits of piety, until it savored of a coarseness
or of a lapse from honor to breathe a word of this
rare ladye's secret, even into the pitiful ears of God's
saints and angels.  Thus earth and sea and sky alike
failed him.  He closed his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a rosy light and a delicious perfumed
warmth seemed to suffuse his body and soul.  Of
course.  His way was plain.  God had frozen his cry
for help upon his lips because it was no longer God's
will that he should mortify his manhood in dogged
fidelity to obsolete vows.  He had vowed his vows in
the belief that the Order would continue, and that he
would live and die in its midst, upheld by its hourly
discipline and devotion.  He had not left the Order:
the Order had left him.  For seven years he had
labored to restore it, and he had failed.  He was free.
</p>

<p>
Free.  Free to be as other men, free to hail the most
wonderful and beautiful of maidens, free to exult over
her, free to receive her marvelous love and to give it
back a thousand-fold.  He opened his eyes, and
involuntarily held out his arms.
</p>

<p>
With bent head Isabel was picking her way up the
slope.  Her exquisite hands held her pretty dress of
sprigged muslin clear of the thorny undergrowth.
Sunbeams played with her golden ringlets.  Antonio
watched her with a sense of intoxication.  This lovely
girl was his, body and spirit, all his.
</p>

<p>
She drew nearer until he could see the blue of her
large eyes, the peach-bloom of her soft cheeks.  Then,
with the suddenness of an earthquake, the greatest
miracle of his life befell.
</p>

<p>
Hundreds of times in the past, especially at seasons
of abounding faith and high ecstasy, he had prayed
that the Blessed Virgin would fly to his relief if ever
he should weaken in this most perilous of his vows.
"Pray for me, O Mother of mothers, O Virgin of
virgins!" he had cried again and again.  "Pray for
me whenever I cannot, or will not, pray for myself."  And,
as Isabel parted the branches behind the mimosa,
those hundreds of old prayers were answered.  Celestial
fire and supernal power filled his whole being so
suddenly and mightily that he was conscious of a physical
pang, of a roaring in his ears like rushing winds
and resounding waters, of a great brightness before his
eyes.
</p>

<h3>
V
</h3>

<p>
The heat of conflict and the flush of victory had
wrought so great a change in Antonio's expression
that Isabel started when they came face to face.  But
she interpreted his transfiguration as an ecstasy of love
and joy; and her blue eyes suddenly shone with a
radiance as wonderful as his own.
</p>

<p>
Before her proud and happy gaze Antonio's cheeks
grew pale.  It was as if a pet lamb were looking up to
him for a caress, when all the time he was gripping a
butcher's knife behind his back.  It was as if some
smiling friend were holding out to him an exquisite
vase full of lilies and roses which he must straightway
dash into pieces.  Isabel seemed so frail, so soft, so
white, so trustful, so lamb-like; and her love was surely
the most fragrant and beautiful thing in all the world.
</p>

<p>
"You are coy," she said laughing gaily.  "And you
have turned as pale as a swooning heroine in an
English novel.  I suppose you're going to say, 'Give me
time: this is so sudden!'"
</p>

<p>
Although Antonio remained silent, no doubt of his
love crossed her mind.  Had she not read love in his
eyes, time after time?  She took it for granted that he
was merely tongue-tied because of the strangeness
of the situation.
</p>

<p>
"You have read it?" she asked, drawing the folded
paper from his unresisting hand.  "Every word?"
</p>

<p>
He bowed assent.  For a minute or two her slender
fingers busied themselves tearing the document first
into ribbons, then into small squares, and finally into
tiny shreds.  After she had mixed the shreds well
together she ran to the lower end of the pool and threw
them, one small handful at a time, into the swirling
rapids.
</p>

<p>
"You are tired," said Antonio when she returned.
"The day is sultry.  Later on there will be thunder.
You have walked a long way.  You must sit down."
</p>

<p>
Isabel seated herself on the flat boulder.  But
although there was room at her side the monk remained
standing.  She pouted unconsciously and darted two
furtive glances at his eyes.  The first glance was only
a glance of slight disappointment and of shy reproof;
but the second was a glance of sudden anguish and
sickening fear.  The silence lengthened until she could
bear it no longer.
</p>

<p>
"Speak to me!" she commanded indignantly.  "Why
do you stand there saying nothing?  I suppose you
despise me?"
</p>

<p>
"Isabel," he said, calling her by her name for the
first time, "you know I don't despise you."
</p>

<p>
He spoke her name in a voice so strangely sweet that
her ears tingled and her heart leaped.  And when his
brown velvet eyes looked into hers with sorrowful
tenderness all her pride broke down.
</p>

<p>
"Then why are you so cruel?" she cried.  "Why
do you make it so hard for me?  Haven't I
humiliated myself enough?  You are cruel.  Why do you
not tell me that you love me?"
</p>

<p>
The supernal grace and might which had miraculously
fulfilled Antonio's body and soul enabled him
to triumph over temptation; but they did not deliver
him from anguish.  The sword which was about to
rend the heart of Isabel scorched him as it circled
downward for its dreadful work.  Her coming ordeal
was already his; and he stood in the midst of it as in
a burning fiery furnace.
</p>

<p>
Isabel sprang up and faced him.  Their eyes were
less than a yard apart.  Antonio's continued silence
was sufficient answer; but she fought fiercely against
the truth.  Clasping her white hands desperately
against her breast, she challenged him in short,
panting sentences.
</p>

<p>
"This is horrible, too horrible," she began, "I tell
you it is too horrible.  You can't, you daren't look
me in the eyes and say you don't love me!"  And
when he still delayed to speak she raised her voice and
commanded sharply: "Answer!"
</p>

<p>
He looked her in the eyes with immeasurable
sadness, and answered:
</p>

<p>
"I do not love you in the way you mean."
</p>

<p>
"The way I mean?  What is the way I mean?
Either you love me or you don't.  There are no two
ways in love."  She spoke hotly and with scorn.
</p>

<p>
"In the paper you've just torn up," he replied, "you
called me your dearest friend in the world.  In that
sense, I love you.  In all the world, you are my dearest
friend."
</p>

<p>
"And no more?  Not an atom more?"
</p>

<p>
He hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"Come," she said bitterly.  "You are trying me too
far.  If this is some subtlety, some finesse, let us save
it until another day.  For the last time, I ask you:
Can you stand up here in the sight of the God you
believe in, and say that I am no more to you than your
dearest friend?"
</p>

<p>
It came home to Antonio that he could not, with
perfect truthfulness, say that she was his friend and
no more.  Yet how was he to evade her question?
Plainly the cruel, hateful moment had come for striking
the fair vase to pieces, for driving the butcher's
knife into the white lamb's heart.  He raised his head
and resumed the mastery over her by a single
movement of his inextinguishable will.
</p>

<p>
"My dearest friend in the world," he said gently.
"If I am to blame for the smallest fraction of this
wonderful and terrible thing which has come to pass,
I crave your pardon here and now with all my heart,
and I will ask God's pardon every day until I die.
But ... for God's sake, let us forget.  Let
yesterday and to-day be as if they had never been.  How
a woman like you could ever waste one thought of love
on a man like me neither of us can explain."
</p>

<p>
She heard him with wildly staring eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You offer me," he concluded, "a gift beyond all
price.  But I must turn my back, I must close my eyes,
I must stop my ears.  I am pledged to another Bride."
</p>

<p>
They were the words he had used to Senhor Jorge.
But, this time, he uttered them proudly; for he had
meditated upon them often since the serão.  He knew
that they were not a mean verbal quibble, and that
they enshrined the foremost fact of his life.  As they
left his lips the spiritual world was as real and near
as the cascade, as real and near as the mossy boulder,
as real and near as Isabel.
</p>

<p>
His delicacy moved the monk to turn away without
even the briefest glance at the effect of his declaration
upon Isabel.  But she did not desire his consideration.
Something magnetic in her anger compelled him to
raise his eyes.  He saw that she too had moved away.
</p>

<p>
"Another Bride?" she repeated slowly, barbing
every syllable with scorn.  "Another Bride?  Indeed.
What an entirely enviable young woman!"
</p>

<p>
For a few moments her sarcasm sustained her.
With her hands hanging easily at her side she stood
haughtily erect, smiling a scornful smile.  But it did
not last.  Without warning she ran towards him and
cried, with a break in her voice:
</p>

<p>
"It isn't true!"
</p>

<p>
"It is true," said the monk, very gently.
</p>

<p>
"It is not true!" she went on, stamping her foot.
"It isn't.  It can't be.  If it were true you would
have told me before.  You'd have dropped a hint,
you'd have talked about her.  I tell you it isn't true.
If it were true you'd have told me when you denied
the talk about Margarida.  You are a man.  You are
not a cur and a brute."
</p>

<p>
"This is unjust," cried Antonio.  "How could I tell
you yesterday, after Margarida?  You ran away
home like the wind.  And why should I drop hints?
Surely they would have been a great impertinence.
How should I dream that you, an English lady, with
a proud old name, would ever think so of me, a
wine-merchant's clerk?"
</p>

<p>
"Then why did you make love to me fifty times?"
she retorted.
</p>

<p>
"Fifty times?  Made love?  This is madness.  On
my honor and conscience I have not breathed a word
of love to you even once."
</p>

<p>
"Who said you'd breathed words?  I didn't.  But
you've made love with your eyes.  Over and over and
over again you have looked at me as if I was as much
to you as you were to me, and as if you and I were
the only beings in the world."
</p>

<p>
"I swear you are mistaken, utterly mistaken," cried
Antonio.
</p>

<p>
Isabel had ceased to listen.  She clenched her hands
together once more against her breast and stood gazing
towards the mists which hid the Atlantic.  When she
spoke again it was not to Antonio.  She seemed
rather to be thinking aloud, with quick impassioned
utterance.
</p>

<p>
"So this is the end," she began.  "Yet how long it
has been in coming!  I have been happy for ten
days&mdash;ten whole days.  When was I ever happy for three
days and nights before?  But it's over now.  What
a memory to carry to my grave&mdash;the memory of this
end!  I've made a fool of myself.  I've made myself
cheaper than dirt.  I've pressed myself on a man who
won't have me."
</p>

<p>
Antonio took a step forward; but, without paying
him the smallest attention, she continued:
</p>

<p>
"It's happened to other women, no doubt.  But the
other women weren't so hungry and thirsty for a little
happiness as I was.  They didn't have mothers who
died the day they were born.  They didn't have
fathers who forget their very existence for months
and months at a time.  They've had homes, they've
had friends, they've had all the lesser love.  But I
... I have had nothing, from anybody, anywhere,
ever."
</p>

<p>
She laughed a laugh like iron against iron.  The
monk could endure it no longer.  He sprang to her
side.  For the first time, he touched her hand.  She
snatched it free as if he had burnt it, and looked at
him fiercely.
</p>

<p>
"Go away," she cried, "I hate you!"
</p>

<p>
"No," he said.  "I won't go away till you are less
unhappy, and till you forgive me."
</p>

<p>
His gentle compulsion mastered her.  She allowed
him to lead her back to the boulder.  This time he sat
down at her side.  As he did so she bent her head.
Tears came into her eyes.  Suddenly she covered her
face with her hands and wept without restraint.
</p>

<p>
Antonio, sitting so near to her that he could have
encircled her with his arm, suffered as bitterly as
Isabel.  The momentary temptation to trample on his
vow no longer had the slightest power over him; but
his whole heart yearned to end her grief, or, at the
least, to comfort her.  She was so like a sobbing,
heartbroken child that it seemed inhuman to sit beside
her without drawing her head to his shoulder or even
stroking her hands.  Yet he knew that it would be
more inhuman still to rise up and move away.
</p>

<p>
She overcame her sobs at last; and, turning upon
him eyes like April skies, she demanded abruptly:
</p>

<p>
"This Bride?  What is she like?"
</p>

<p>
"Let us not talk of her now," said Antonio, as soon
as he could command his words.  "Surely it is better
not."
</p>

<p>
"Is she like Margarida?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Prettier?"
</p>

<p>
"For Heaven's sake," he pleaded, "do not ask these
questions?"
</p>

<p>
"Answer me at once.  Is she prettier than I am?
In England they call me pretty.  I suppose I'm ugly
to a Portuguese.  I suppose she's a hundred times
more beautiful than I am."
</p>

<p>
"There are different kinds of beauty," said Antonio.
</p>

<p>
"Is she clever?"
</p>

<p>
Antonio considered well.  Then he replied:
</p>

<p>
"In Her case I should not use the word 'clever.'  But,
I entreat you, ask me no more."
</p>

<p>
He rose to his feet with a look which silenced her.
A moment afterwards she too sprang up.  Stepping
quickly to the pool, she dipped her little handkerchief
in the laughing water and tried to bathe away the
traces of her tears.  When she sailed back towards
him she came proudly.
</p>

<p>
"This ought to be the end," she said.  "I ought not
to see you alone again.  But I don't forbid you to
come just once more.  Perhaps I shall be here
to-morrow morning.  I don't say I shall, and I don't say
I shan't."
</p>

<p>
Her steady gaze commanded an answer: but it was
only by a huge effort that Antonio succeeded in
replying:
</p>

<p>
"You have spoken truly.  We ought not to meet
alone again."
</p>

<p>
"No, we ought not.  Most decidedly we ought not,"
she flashed back scornfully.  "But we will!"
</p>

<p>
And without another word or glance she hastened
away.
</p>

<h3>
VI
</h3>

<p>
Isabel could not sleep.  In order to postpone the hour
of solitude she had sat up late talking to Fisher,
practising Portuguese with Joanninha, and writing letters
to her few friends in England.  Finally she had
astounded Mrs. Baxter by asking to be told all about
the early life of the callous young Viscountess Datton
and by listening without a murmur to the details which
the Excellent Creature multitudinously invented.  But
the moment came when Mrs. Baxter's love of bed
overbore her love of hearing herself talk.  She rang
the bell and Jackson came in, yawning, with the
candles.
</p>

<p>
When Isabel lay down she set the whole power of
her will to the barricading of her mind against the
day's cruel memories.  But it was all in vain.  Every
word she had spoken to Antonio, every syllable of his
replies, vibrated afresh in her ears, scorching them
with shame.  Twice or thrice she clenched her fist as
if she would strike some invisible enemy or revenge
herself on the author of her loss and humiliation.
Sometimes her cheeks burned crimson: sometimes she
felt all the blood ebb from them.  Her spiritual
anguish brought in its wake a physical pain, sickening
and hardly bearable, like the pains after the first shock
of a dizzy fall or a brutal blow.  She seemed to be
aching all over; and more than once she moaned aloud.
</p>

<p>
Even without her shame and grief Isabel could
hardly have slept.  All through the afternoon and
evening the air had been growing sultrier and sultrier.
Not once in England, not even during brazen August,
had she known such a stifling heat.  Both her windows
stood wide open; but they seemed to be admitting
fiery vapors rather than life-giving airs.  Even the fine
linen sheet was too hot and heavy to be endured.  She
flung it aside and lay with nothing to cover her save a
plain night-robe of the thinnest Indian silk.  At first
she tossed from side to side; but so much exertion soon
exhausted her, and she lay still, gasping for breath.
</p>

<p>
At length the heat became unendurable.  She rose
and went to the window.  Two or three miles away,
over the woods, over the abbey, beyond Antonio's
farm, the surly Atlantic was growling his muffled
growl through the sultry air.  Quite near at hand the
shrunken torrent was rumbling down through the
underwoods.  Isabel listened.  The airy ocean and
the seaward-hurrying brook seemed to invite her, and
to be beckoning her with cool hands.  She leaned out,
fain to be a little nearer.
</p>

<p>
There was no moon, and the stars could not pierce
the stagnant clouds.  Yet the night was not solidly
dark.  The outlines of the taller trees could be traced
against the sky, and the pavement which surrounded
the guest-house glimmered like white limestone.
</p>

<p>
Isabel was suddenly filled with an overmastering
desire to break her prison walls and to walk free under
the open sky.  Apart from its bitter associations she
would have lacked courage to visit the pool and the
cascade in the dead of night; for the narrow path
thither wound in and out of somber thickets.  But the
broad way, broad enough for a carriage, which ran
down from the guest-house to the abbey, and thence,
through the avenue of camellias, to the principal gate
had no terrors for a soul almost untroubled by superstitious
fears.  It seemed to the half-stifled, heart-sick
Isabel that if she could escape from the house unheard
by Jackson and Mrs. Baxter she might find life and
healing in those ampler spaces.  She did not admit to
herself that the broad path and, especially, the paved
space in front of the abbey attracted her because they
were rich in unembittered memories of hours with
Antonio.  Room, more room; air, more air: she
thought she wanted nothing besides.
</p>

<p>
Having dressed herself swiftly in her lightest
garments she threw over her hair a black lace mantilla
which she had bought in Oporto, thrust her shoes and
stockings into her little bag and crept barefoot to the
door.  It creaked a little when she closed it behind her;
but the steady sequence of sounds which continued
to come from the bedroom of Mrs. Baxter proved that
the Excellent Creature had heard nothing.  Isabel
turned away with a shrug of distaste, and descended
the stairs.  There was no need to listen for the snoring
of Jackson, who could have gone on sleeping restfully
if she had clattered about the corridor in clogs.
</p>

<p>
The two bolts of the front door were not very hard
to draw back, and the latch was easily lifted.  On the
top step, where she had talked thrice with Antonio,
Isabel drew on her stockings and shoes.  Then she
closed the door behind her, latched it softly, and stole
on tiptoe out of earshot down the path.
</p>

<p>
It was not much cooler in the open than in her
chamber.  Still, she was glad that she had exchanged
her narrow cell for freedom.  Besides, the
far-stretching woods and the vast heavens were more in
scale with her immeasurable sorrow.  She walked on
quickly, eager to hasten away from her hateful prison.
The path was cheerful because it led down to the open
lowlands and the refreshing sea.
</p>

<p>
Midnight, to Isabel's mind, usually held no more
terrors than noonday.  But when a vague shape
confronted her under a tree she started violently.
Some gossip of Joanninha's awoke in her memory&mdash;some
ridiculous village story about a ghostly monk
who haunted the domain on dark nights.  Advancing
boldly upon it she found that the vague shape was
only a dead trunk clothed in creepers.  She tried to
laugh; but the laugh would not come, and suddenly
she knew what was meant by fear.
</p>

<p>
Her instinct was to turn and run home.  But the
path behind her, backed by the enormous mass of the
mountain, looked like a tunnel bored through coal,
while the path ahead of her led towards Antonio and
José, towards the soft lights and faint voices of the sea.
Daring neither to go back nor to stand still, she hurried
on until her foot struck a slab of stone.
</p>

<p>
She had reached the paved space in front of the
abbey.  The western gable of the chapel hulked up
high into the gloom, like the poop of a man-o'-war
aground.  Upon the warm stone steps, with her back
to the door, she sat down until she had regained all her
breath and lost nearly all her fears.  Isabel saw no
reason why she should not sit there until dawn.  She
hid her face in her hands, and tried to sleep.
</p>

<p>
A growling in the east aroused her.  It was no
louder than the Atlantic's growling in the west.  Isabel
knew that it was thunder; but it seemed to be so far
away that she was not alarmed.  What surprised her
was its long protraction.  Unlike the intermittent din
of an English thunderstorm it rumbled on unceasingly,
until Isabel could almost have believed that she was
listening to the echoes of an Armageddon raging among
the burnt, far-off hills of Spain.  Suddenly, however,
a blaze of lightning showed her the terrified Atlantic's
ashen face.  She had never dreamed of such lightning
before.  Flash trod upon flash so eagerly that there
was a continuous dance of light.  The half-seconds of
dimness between seemed more positive than the
lightning.  They were like the convulsive twitchings of a
great eyelid over a terrible eye; and Isabel thought
she saw flashes of darkness rather than flashes of
light.
</p>

<p>
From the neighborhood of the stepping-stones came
a shattering noise, as sharp as a pistol-shot and as loud
as an exploding magazine.  Immediately, afterwards,
as if obeying a preconcerted signal, a fearful
cannonading and fusillading began to rage on every hand.
Armageddon had swept westward.
</p>

<p>
Isabel sprang up and huddled back into the scanty
shelter of the shallow doorway.  So long as there was
no rain she welcomed the gigantic grandeur of the
thunder, and the cold, pitiless beauty of the lightning.
But the rain's herald did not delay to blow his blast.
Isabel could not see them; but she felt a swirl of dust
and dead leaves rush past her in obedience to his
command.  Gritty atoms clung to her lips.  At the same
moment ten thousand trees began to rock and moan in
pain; and a warm drop fell upon Isabel's hand.
</p>

<p>
Down rushed the rain.  At first it struck straight
down from heaven, but, after a few seconds, it smote
the wood slantwise, like millions of thin javelins hurled
from a height.  The thunder never ceased crackling,
banging, booming; and the lightnings were so bright
that the tree-trunks stood like smoke-blackened men
wielding brilliant scimitars amidst the flying javelins.
</p>

<p>
Isabel was greedily watching the strife when the
wind veered, and a battery of rain discharged its whole
broadside full at her face.  The gust lasted only a
moment; but, when it had passed, her thin dinner-dress
was wet all over.  She knew that there would be
fifty gusts all as bad as the first or worse, and that she
must either enter the chapel or be drenched to the skin.
</p>

<p>
She drew the key from her bag.  The lightnings
served her for a lantern as she drove the steel into the
keyhole; but before she could turn it in the lock another
burst of cold rain smacked rudely at her bare shoulders.
At length she pushed back the door.  The lightnings
seemed to leap into the chapel the moment she opened
it, like a pack of eager dogs rushing in before their
master.  Swifter than greyhounds the cold white-and-blue
radiance flashed over the cold white-and-blue of
the azulejos, and then licked back into the dark.
</p>

<p>
In her retreat from the rain Isabel had forgotten
supernatural terrors.  But as soon as she was fairly
over the threshold Joanninha's ghost-story rushed
anew into her mind, and she was thankful for the
lightnings which had shown her that the place was
empty.  Yet she dared not shut herself up in the
chapel; so she resolved to stand just inside.
</p>

<p>
Without any warning a third gust sucked the great
door out of her weak hand.  The oak fell to, with a
bang, which was nearly drowned in a sharp clap of
thunder.  Isabel leaped back to reopen it, and tugged
at the handle with all her might.  But the bolts and
springs of the lock had done their work.  And the key
was outside.
</p>

<p>
Isabel did not lose her head.  As soon as she had
recovered from the first shock, the good blood of her
old English stock thrilled in her veins.  Here was an
adventure.  Antonio instantly flew into her thoughts,
as usual.  To-morrow she would meet Antonio.  To-morrow
she would tell him, this contemptuous Antonio,
how she had passed a night of thunder and lightning
in a haunted chapel.  To-morrow Antonio should be
made to realize what sort of a woman he was flouting.
To-morrow Antonio would hang his head at the
thought of his dull, superstitious, spiritless Portuguese
bride.
</p>

<p>
Propping herself against the wall she took stock of
the situation.  The chapel was dry; and although her
dress was wet it was not wet enough to give her a cold.
In four or five hours it would be daylight, and she
would have courage to find the spiral staircase.  Once
on the flat roof of the cloister she would be able to see
Jackson and the other servants searching for her.
Jackson and the servants and Antonio.  They would
be sure to send first thing for Antonio.
</p>

<p>
The warmth with which she pictured Antonio's
arrival ebbed away when she suddenly remembered
that she was leaning against the blue-and-white
tile-painting of the Saint's death at Tyburn.  With a little
shiver she crossed over to the azulejos representing the
Saint's birth.  Meanwhile, the rain was still lashing
the glass, and the thunder was making a din like the
toppling of crags into cañons.  What troubled her
most was the jeweled crown on the head of the image
above the altar.  The bluish-white lightning seemed
to have an affinity for the bluish-white stones, and
several times Isabel felt sure that the brilliance lingered
among the points of the diadem after it had fled from
the rest of the chapel.
</p>

<p>
Once she could have sworn that some one entered
through the cloister doorway, and that footsteps
sounded upon the pavement; but the thunder was loud
at the time, and she decided that she had only heard
its reverberations.  None the less, the fright weakened
her nerve.  All in a moment she felt weary, chilly,
hungry, and so utterly miserable that she nearly cried.
She pulled herself up in time and tried to brace up her
nerves by chewing the bitter bark of irony.  "This is
one of my lucky days," she said to herself.  "From
this morning onward it has been wholly delightful.
What a good grateful girl I ought to be!"
</p>

<p>
An ear-splitting clap of thunder put an end to her
soliloquy.  So awful was the crash that Isabel listened
shuddering for the noise of falling walls and roofs.
Not one stone or slate gave way; but she heard a
sound a thousand times more fearful.  It was a voice,
a mumbling voice which seemed to prolong the worn-out
rumblings of the thunder; a voice deep and rich;
the voice of a man; a voice somewhere in the chapel.
</p>

<p>
Her heart nearly stopped beating.  She strained
terrified eyes into the furthest darkness.  And she did not
strain them in vain.  In close succession four or five
white beams of lightning lit up the choir.
</p>

<p>
A monk, in black, was kneeling before the altar.
</p>

<p>
Isabel's piercing scream was louder than the thunder
and the rain.  She collapsed in a heap on the
pavement.  But she did not swoon.  Struggling to her feet
she dashed herself desperately against the massive
door.  It stood like a rock.  Moaning wildly, she
dragged at the lock with both hands.  It did not yield
a hair's-breadth.  A moment later she heard footsteps;
and turning round she had one lightning vision of the
black monk hurrying towards her.  She shrieked again
and made a dash in the direction of the cloister
doorway.  Before she could reach it another white flash
showed her the black monk only an arm's length away.
As the flash passed she struck a mad blow into the
darkness and, hitting nothing, she stumbled and fell
forward.  But two strong, unghostly arms caught her
just in time; and instead of striking the cold stones she
found herself upheld by something soft and warm.
</p>

<p>
Without waiting for the lightning to reveal his face,
Isabel knew that she was in the arms of Antonio.
Never in her life before had she yielded to any man's
caress, save the rare and shamefaced kisses of her
father.  Yet Antonio's arms seemed to be her natural
place, like its nest to a bird.  For a few seconds she
did not think of identifying the black monk.  She
believed that the black monk had been on the point of
striking her dead, and that some grand magic of love
had conjured up Antonio to stand between them in the
nick of time.  Trembling like a leaf and panting like a
runner after a race, she pressed and clung to him, as a
terrified child clings to its mother in the dark.
</p>

<p>
"You are Isabel?" said Antonio.  He had known
from her first scream that it was she; but he thought
it might comfort her to hear his voice speaking her
name.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I am Isabel," she murmured.  And although
a sharp memory of the plighted Bride bade her banish
herself at once from his clasp she abandoned herself
more than before to the warmth and softness of his
gentle strength.
</p>

<p>
"You are safe, quite safe," he said; for she was
still trembling all over.  "There is no ghost.  It was
only I."
</p>

<p>
No ghost?  Only he?  What did it mean?  Isabel
roused her deliciously drowsing wits.  No ghost.
Only he.  She opened her eyes.  But the chapel was
filled full with darkness, and she could not see his face.
</p>

<p>
A moment afterwards a prolonged blazing of huge
lightnings made the place brighter than day.  The
azulejos, the high windows, and the gilded carvings
shone out like blue and white and yellow fires.  Isabel
could see Antonio's anxious eyes gazing down into her
own.  And she had time to see much more.  She saw
his Benedictine habit; she saw that he and the black
monk were one and the same man.
</p>

<p>
She leaped away from him in terror.  But terror did
not endure.  At the touch of his reassuring hand
seeking her arm in the gloom, a light as bright as the
lightning's blazed within her and a thunderbolt of
overwhelming joy swept her off her feet.  With a
great cry of gladness she flung herself once more
against his breast.
</p>

<p>
"It's true, it's really true?" she clamored.  "Speak.
Answer me at once.  You're not deceiving me?
Your Bride is not a real woman after all?"
</p>

<p>
"You have surprised my secret, and I trust you to
keep it," he answered.  "When the monks were here
they knew me as Father Antonio."
</p>

<p>
"Antonio, Antonio, Antonio&mdash;what a beautiful
name!" she cried.  "Come, Father Antonio, tell me.
Your Bride is only Religion, or the Church, or the
Virgin, or something like that?"
</p>

<p>
Her tone dismayed the monk even more than her
words shocked him; and he remained silent.
</p>

<p>
"You cannot deny it," she exulted.  Another flash
of lightning silenced her; but the radiant eyes and
glowing cheeks on which it shone were more eloquent
than her words.  And as soon as the swift darkness
closed over them her words rang in it like New Year's
bells at midnight.  "You don't deny it, you can't, you
daren't," she sang.  "Your Bride is all a mere
sentiment, like the azulejos; a romance; an ideal."
</p>

<p>
"First of all," demanded Antonio, "how did you
come here to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"God sent me.  I believe there's a God, at last."
</p>

<p>
He moved a little, so as to loosen her clasp.  But, in
her almost hysterical rapture, she did not perceive the
movement.
</p>

<p>
"You are wet through," he said.  But she only
answered:
</p>

<p>
"What does it matter?"
</p>

<p>
"Quick!" he commanded.  "There is a lull in the
rain.  You must go home this moment."
</p>

<p>
"I won't," said she.  "We will stay here."
</p>

<p>
"Isabel," he retorted sternly, "we will not stay here.
You are mad.  The storm has driven you out of your
senses.  Or perhaps it was the ghost you thought you
saw.  You must go home this instant.  What if you
have been missed?  What if your servants should find
us here?  What will Mrs. Baxter say?  And what
shall I say to your father?"
</p>

<p>
Until he spoke his last sentence Isabel heard him
unmoved; but at the thought of her father the arms
which held Antonio weakened.  Very slowly she let
him go.  None the less, she sought to argue.  The
monk, however, enforced his will.  Gripping her arm
he marched her almost roughly to the west door, and
fumbled for the lock.
</p>

<p>
"It's no use," she said.  "The key is outside.  We
must stay here."
</p>

<p>
His only answer was to take her arm again and to
lead her through the smaller doorway into the cloister.
At the moment of their emerging from the chapel a
shaft of lightning lit up a bubbling lake of muddy
water, under which lay drowned the cloister garden.
Two sides of the cloister itself were also under water.
</p>

<p>
"I am frightened," she said, with genuine fear, as
Antonio drew her into a gloomy corridor.  He could
feel her shrinking back and trembling; so he threw his
arm around her waist and hurried her on.  As they
passed through the kitchen the uproar of the torrent
reminded Antonio of the night of his fight with José.
But he did not pause.  He threaded passage after
passage, room after room, until he had worked round to
the little door with the Reading monk's secret lock.
His fingers searched among the hidden levers, and at
last the door stood open.
</p>

<p>
Frequent lightning still swept sea and land; but the
thunder had dragged its great guns northward and
was pounding over Navares.  The rain had ceased.
The monk, however, did not hurry Isabel over the
threshold; for the overarching trees were pouring
down water like an aqueduct cracked by an
earthquake.  He considered earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"Come," he said, with an abruptness which startled
her.  "I must wrap you in this cloak."
</p>

<p>
With much tucking and folding he contrived to wrap
his habit about her slender body and to adjust the
mantilla over her fragrant hair.
</p>

<p>
"Now, I suppose, I'm a nun," she laughed.
</p>

<p>
The speech would have stung him had he not remembered
her behavior in his cell, twelve days before,
and her evident persuasion that monks and nuns were
only picturesque archaisms, with no serious existence
outside the pages of novelists and the dreams of pious
sentimentalists.  But he did not give her time to
expand her flippancy.
</p>

<p>
"Let us go," he said.
</p>

<p>
They went.  For about twenty paces the paved
causeway which led to the little door gave them dry
foothold.  Thenceforward, however, the paths to the
guest-house had become rushing streams.  Even without
the aid of the lightning one could see gleaming
water everywhere.  Isabel glanced down dolefully at
her feet.
</p>

<p>
"We can't," she said.
</p>

<p>
"We must," he insisted.
</p>

<p>
"Look at my shoes," she moaned.
</p>

<p>
Antonio considered again.  Then he asked:
</p>

<p>
"You will let me carry you?"
</p>

<p>
"If we can't wait," she answered, after a long pause,
"and if you're sure there's no other way ... you
may carry me."
</p>

<p>
He stepped down from the causeway and bent his
back so that she could seat herself upon his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"You must hold fast," he said.
</p>

<p>
Very shyly she slipped round his neck a soft arm
which trembled.  Antonio straightened himself up and
plashed forward.  Once or twice he came to dips in the
path where the water was higher than his knees, but
the young giant stamped through the whirlpools like
another Saint Christopher.  On they went, guided by
the flickering lightning.  At length they reached the
main path.  It was hardly ankle deep in water.  He
quickened his pace, until the guest-house loomed in
sight.  Then he gently set Isabel down on a boulder
away from the drip of the trees and released her from
the clumsy habit, which he folded up and laid on
another great stone.
</p>

<p>
"You left the door unlocked?" he whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"For Heaven's sake don't speak so loud.  Better still,
don't speak at all.  I'm going to carry you as softly as
I can to the steps.  Don't breathe a word on the way.
And don't open the door until I am back under the
trees.  I shall wait to see that you are safe.  Now!"
</p>

<p>
"No, no, not yet," she whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Now.  This moment.  You are mad."
</p>

<p>
"I know.  But, Antonio, promise.  To-morrow
morning.  At the cascade."
</p>

<p>
"I promise," he said.
</p>

<p>
Once more he lifted her up: but this time, as the
distance was so short, he carried her in his arms like a
child.  He did not look at her; but he knew that she
was strangely light with a fairy lightness, that her
shoulders were snow and her hair pure gold, and that
she was as fine and delicate as a lily.  Before he took
his first stride towards the guest-house he paused,
straining his ears for any sound within.  Around him,
in the woods, a hundred little streams went bubbling
and tinkling.  Here and there thankful birds were
piping their peace-pipes after the din of the battle.
The chant of the Atlantic, freshened by the breeze,
was loud and glad.
</p>

<p>
"Listen, Antonio," she murmured.  "All the world
is singing."
</p>

<p>
Gripping her as if he would choke her next words
before she could speak them, the monk crossed the
path.  Twelve strides sufficed him for their journey.
At the foot of the steps he put her down; and, before
she could whisper Good-night, he was speeding
noiselessly back to the great stone.
</p>

<p>
As soon as she had entered the guest-house and
closed the door he made haste to put on his habit; for
the air had grown cold.  Then he shrank into the
dripping trees and waited.  By this time the clouds
were gone and the stars were shining.
</p>

<p>
Isabel appeared at the window and beckoned
imperiously.  He stole softly forward and saw her hand
moving like a white butterfly among the creepers
clustering round the casement.  She broke off a
half-blown rose which had not been shattered by the storm
and threw it to Antonio.  He caught it deftly; but
his fingers closed too tightly on its thorns, and when he
re-entered the abbey to exchange his habit for his old
cloak he saw that the white flower was flecked and
veined with blood.
</p>

<h3>
VII
</h3>

<p>
It was Isabel who arrived first at the pool.  She found
the stepping-stones impassable.  A cypress had been
struck by lightning, and the wind and rain had torn
millions of autumn leaves from the other trees.  But
the storm was over, the mists and stifling heats were
gone, and the clear sunshine was tempered by a
pleasant breeze.
</p>

<p>
When Antonio joined her the roar of the swollen
cataract was so enormous that he had almost to shout
in her ear.
</p>

<p>
"We must go somewhere else," he said.  "Here we
can't hear ourselves speak.  And the ground is too wet.
Come."
</p>

<p>
She followed as he led the way up the mountain.
Reaching a point where the torrent was pent within a
resounding gorge they leaped easily to the other side.
Then they descended, slanting away from the water,
until they came to a stone platform which supported a
small ruinous chapel.  It was one of the oldest shrines
in the domain; but Antonio could not remember the
time when it had contained an image or an altar.
</p>

<p>
"You have hurt your hand," she said.  "What has
cut it?"
</p>

<p>
"The thorns of a rose," he answered quietly.
</p>

<p>
His curtness disappointed Isabel.  After her painful
experience of his perverse obstinacy the morning
before, she could not expect him to be converted from his
folly or cured of his religious mania all in a moment,
and she had come prepared for vigorous debate.  But
his cold self-possession and, above all, his avoidance of
her eyes, dismayed her.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, you've thrown the rose away?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"No, I have not thrown it away."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
He spread his cloak on a carved stone bench for her
to sit on, and did not answer.
</p>

<p>
"Why?" she repeated.  "I want Father Antonio to
explain.  Are monks allowed to treasure up dead
flowers?  You'll be asking next for a tress of my
hair."
</p>

<p>
He maintained his grim silence.  Embarrassment
and injured pride colored her cheeks a warm red; but
she was determined to make him speak.
</p>

<p>
"I mean," she added, "that you won't ask for a lock
of my hair at all.  You'll expect me to go down in the
dust and offer it you on my knees, and to coax you and
implore you for days and days until you condescend
to accept it.  Your Majesty is a true Lord of Creation.
He leaves me to do all the wooing."
</p>

<p>
This time Antonio looked at her fairly and squarely.
She sat down and faced him with a pout on her lips
and a toss of the head.  In her heart she felt sure of
victory; and she yearned to get over the preliminary
skirmishes as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>
"Begin, your Reverence," she said.  "Preach at me.
Excommunicate me.  Do your worst.  I am ready."
</p>

<p>
"Ought I to begin," he asked, "by craving pardon for
trespassing last night in the chapel?"
</p>

<p>
"No, you ought not.  It wouldn't be sincere;
because you believe the chapel is more yours than mine.
And, most decidedly, you oughtn't to begin as if we
are mortal enemies.  Why are your tones as sharp and
cold as icicles?  And why do you glare at me as if you
hate me?"
</p>

<p>
"I hate nobody," he replied.  "But I hate this talk
which we are compelled to have."
</p>

<p>
"Then let us make haste and be done with it.  Explain.
I want to know why you pretend to be still a
monk, when you're really a farmer?"
</p>

<p>
"I pretend nothing," said Antonio firmly.  "You
will keep my secret.  You will not name it even to
your father.  Above all, you will hide it from your
servants, and from the chief of the Villa Branca
Fazenda.  I am, and I shall be till I die, a monk of the
Order of Saint Benedict."
</p>

<p>
"Monks have been abolished in Portugal for years
and years," she objected.
</p>

<p>
"You mean that monks have been exiled and monasteries
suppressed.  Monks cannot be abolished.  Men
can pull down blinds and put up shutters and sit in
darkness; but they cannot abolish the sun."
</p>

<p>
"Choose some other illustration," she begged.
"Surely it is monks who put up shutters and draw
down blinds and shut out the light."
</p>

<p>
She proceeded to rattle off half a dozen well-worn
objections to the monastic life.  Her words were her
own; but underneath their freshness and liveliness
Antonio recognized the stock tirade against monks and
nuns which he had heard twenty times in England.
He listened patiently till she had finished.  Then he
said:
</p>

<p>
"We are not thinking of the same thing.  Such
monks and nuns as you are scorning do not exist.
They are figments of your controversialists.  They are
stuffed figures, set up like skittles to be knocked down
again.  May I speak quite candidly?"
</p>

<p>
"Speak quite candidly, or do not speak at all," she
answered.
</p>

<p>
"And personally?"
</p>

<p>
"The more personally the better."
</p>

<p>
"Then listen.  You remember our first Wednesday&mdash;the
day you and I and young Crowberry went all
through the monastery?"
</p>

<p>
"You mean the day you brought me the little blue
bird with the orange-colored tail?"
</p>

<p>
"You remember," continued Antonio, "how I
showed you a monk's cell.  That cell was mine.  I
lived in it for seven years.  You pulled open all the
drawers and looked inside the cupboard."
</p>

<p>
Isabel flushed crimson, and demanded indignantly:
</p>

<p>
"How did I know it was yours?"
</p>

<p>
"You didn't know it was mine," he answered gently.
"Still, it was certainly somebody's.  For a moment, as
you peeped and rummaged, I was distressed and
disappointed.  How could I reconcile it with your
delicacy?  But I soon found the answer.  I understood
that you thought of monks as you might think
of your British Druids or of the Crusaders or of the
Incas of Peru or of the Andalusian Moors&mdash;men that
have lived and breathed once, men that were
picturesque, men that figure well in romances, but, most
of all, men that are utterly dead and gone and done
with.  Perhaps it is natural for you so to think.
Your England has been without monks, save in holes
and corners, for three hundred years."
</p>

<p>
She was on the point of asking what all this might
be leading to, when he added:
</p>

<p>
"Again, last night, when I wrapped you in my habit,
you laughed and said: 'Now I suppose I am a nun.'  You
no more intended to make fun of holy things
than a bird intends sacrilege when it darts into a church
and knocks down candles and vases with its wings.
But you said it, all the same."
</p>

<p>
"I don't deny saying it," she retorted; "I know
perfectly well that I am coarse and wicked enough
to say anything."
</p>

<p>
"I am not blaming you, Isabel," he said gently.
"You are not coarse and you are not wicked.  We
are at variance on the greatest of issues; but may
God forbid that we should quarrel."
</p>

<p>
The softness with which he spoke her name disarmed
Isabel; and the fountains of lovingkindness
which overbrimmed his words quenched the fire of
wrath in her breast.  To make sure that he was forgiven
Antonio gazed at her with eyes so full of the old
searching tenderness that a lump rose in her throat,
and she looked away.
</p>

<p>
"No, I am not blaming you, Isabel," he continued.
What I mean is this.  You find it impossible to take
all these things seriously.  You think I enjoy dressing
up in a monk's cowl and reciting a monk's Latin
Office in a monk's stall, pretty much as other men
enjoy putting on crowns and ermine and going to
masques as princes and kings.  You don't see that the
mere cowl is very little more than nothing, and that
a monk's faith and hope and love are nearly everything.
You cried out in the chapel last night: 'So
your Bride is only Religion, or only the Church, or
only the Virgin.'  Yes 'Only.'  You said 'only.'  And
I am not quibbling on a mere word.  You meant that
a mortal bride&mdash;such a bride, for example, as
Margarida&mdash;would be more real, more important, more
entitled to my lifelong loyalty."
</p>

<p>
He ceased.  After pondering a little she raised
her eyes and said:
</p>

<p>
"In the main you are right.  I'm afraid my vague
notions of monks are not worth the trouble; but you
have analyzed them correctly.  In England we have
some people who want to revive medieval tournaments
with mailed men and horses, and lists, and
queens of beauty, all complete.  To me a modern monastery
is practically the same thing, except that it's
less interesting and more useless."
</p>

<p>
"I do not know enough of your mind," he said
slowly.  "After all, monasticism is not the whole of
the Church.  The Church is wider and older than her
religious orders.  Do you object only to monasticism
in particular?  Or are you equally impatient of the
Church in general?"
</p>

<p>
"By the Church," she answered, "no doubt you
mean Roman Catholicism.  If so, I'm not a fair
judge.  I was educated with a bias against it, and I
am gradually finding out that I was taught a great
deal which was unfair and much that was untrue.
But I will answer you as frankly as possible.  Don't
be hurt.  I love the Church as I love a ruin in a
landscape; but I should not love her if somebody should
accomplish the impossible, and put her in a thorough
state of repair."
</p>

<p>
Springing up she stepped to the tumbledown shrine
and laid her hands on the mossy shafts of its ivy-hung
portal.
</p>

<p>
"Be honest," she said.  "Is not this little chapel far
more beautiful in decay than ever it was when the roof
didn't leak and these creepers were not allowed to
twine about it?  If I could wave a wand and bid
every beauty-spot of moss vanish from the walls and
make all the stones dead-white and all the angels
sharp and true, would you love it as you do now?
And it's the same, the very same, with the Church.
When she was mistress of Europe, she was gaunt
and hard and repellent.  But she is marvelously
picturesque in her decay.  I don't know what our poets
and painters and romancers would do without her."
</p>

<p>
"I still read English papers, and I know what you
mean," said Antonio.  "There is a fashion growing
up among your poets of making free with the holiest
things.  They affect the reverence and simplicity of
medieval believers when, in reality, they are robbing
altars and looting sacristies to fill a property-box with
theatrical properties.  Chalices, censers, copes,
chasubles, dalmatics, miters, pyxes; bishops, abbots, nuns,
monks, friars, acolytes; crypts, stained glass, pointed
arches, carven canopies&mdash;I see that all these are no
more to them than stage backgrounds, stage puppets,
stage dresses, stage tricks."
</p>

<p>
"It makes the poems and paintings much more
gorgeous, anyhow," she interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"No doubt," said Antonio sternly.  "Just as the
palaces and harems of the Turks were more gorgeous
after they had sacked the Holy Places.  Let the
Church be persecuted more than ever in your country,
and I do not fear for her; but I tremble at the thought
of your cleverest men taking her name in vain and
praising her with their lips, while they are still
obstinate pagans in their hearts and lives.  Out of such
blasphemy I foresee the birth of monstrous sins."
</p>

<p>
"Until this morning," retorted Isabel, grievously
disappointed in him, "I thought you were no worse
than over-pious, and a little over-sentimental about
your religious memories.  I could never have believed
that you would be bigoted and narrow-minded.  Your
prophecy only makes me shudder.  I repeat that the
beautiful decay of the Church is bringing more beauty
into art; and I believe that more beauty in art will
bring more beauty into life.  Yet you say it will give
birth to monstrous sins."
</p>

<p>
For a long time Antonio did not reply.  When he
spoke his tone was so much altered that Isabel thought
he accepted his defeat in argument.
</p>

<p>
"Look at this," he said, pointing to a stone which
lay near his foot.  It had been a gargoyle on the
shrine, but must have fallen to the ground before
Antonio was born.  Even if the shallow carving had
not been almost rubbed away by the hand of time
Isabel could hardly have made out its outlines through
the silken mosses and tiny ivies which covered it.
</p>

<p>
"It was part of the shrine once," he said.  "I admit
it looks more beautiful broken off and lying here in
decay.  I've never noticed it before.  It ought to be
in the porch.  It isn't heavy.  Will you help me to
carry it?"
</p>

<p>
They stooped down together.  The unclouded sun
had already dried both the gargoyle and its mossage
and leafage.  Isabel took her fair share of the work,
and between them they easily lifted the stone from the
ground.  But they had not borne it twenty inches
towards the shrine before she let go and sprang clear,
with a scream.  The gargoyle struck upon a knob of
rock and smashed into three pieces.
</p>

<p>
Antonio's glance followed Isabel's.  She was gazing
with horror at the long black grave from which they
had wrenched the stone.  It was a nest of centipedes.
The creatures writhed this way and that, like the letter
S, incalculably multiplied and gone mad.  Some of
them were bright scarlet, some were sickly yellow.
Beyond them, half of a long worm, bald and clammy,
lay across the slimy track of some hidden slug.  A
scurrying ear-wig touched it, and the worm disappeared
as if by magic into the earth.  Meanwhile two
horny beetles were shouldering their way through the
stubby grass.
</p>

<p>
The monk had hardly realized the success of his too
vivid allegory when he saw that Isabel had snatched
up her skirts and fled.  He grabbed his cloak and
leaped after her; but although he was almost immediately
at her side, she continued her flight without
recognizing his existence.  After two or three minutes a
swollen tributary of the torrent brought her to a halt.
</p>

<p>
"I am so sorry," he said, very humbly.  "I never
thought it could be so horrible as that."
</p>

<p>
"You're sorry too late," she cried.  "I know you
love me; yet you're always acting as if you despise
me.  It's your chief delight to humiliate me.  Religion
ruins you.  Till we get to religion your heart is
tenderer than a woman's; but, when religion comes in,
I believe you'd burn me at the stake and feel proud
of it."
</p>

<p>
Great tears came into her eyes; but before he saw
them he had already recognized how thoughtless and
unkind he had been in luring her to lift the gargoyle.
The sight of the tears completed his repentance.
</p>

<p>
"With my whole heart I ask pardon," he pleaded,
"although what I did was almost unpardonable.  I
didn't think; but it was selfish and brutal to score a
point like that.  Isabel, try to forgive me."
</p>

<p>
Whenever he spoke her name and looked into her
eyes she became as clay in his hands.  But Antonio
did not know it.  He took her silence to mean anything
but pardon; and therefore his tone was humbler than
ever as he added:
</p>

<p>
"We cannot part like this, Isabel.  These rocks are
dry and warm to your feet.  We shall find no better
spot."
</p>

<p>
He spread his cloak for her once more, and sat down
at her side.  Two or three minutes passed without a
word.  Then she said:
</p>

<p>
"If I am all wrong about monks, I am willing to be
put right.  What are monks for?  Why do they
exist?"
</p>

<p>
Antonio hesitated.  There were so many gaps in her
knowledge and in her sympathy.  How could he explain
the topmost flowering of churchly life to one who
knew so little of the root and the trunk and the
branches?  At last he replied:
</p>

<p>
"You have spoken of painters and writers.  Is it not
true that both painting and writing have advanced
almost entirely through the diligence of professional
writers and painters?  How soon the amateur slips
back without the example of the professional to steady
him!  In our wars we have always found that a few
professional soldiers can stiffen citizen levies who
would otherwise run away.  Monks, so to speak, are
the professional Christians, devoting their lives to piety
and the pursuit of perfection.  I don't mean that they
are professional like your English clergy.  Monks are
not professional shepherds.  I might say that they are
professional sheep, a professional flock, exemplifying,
as Christians in the world can hardly do, blamelessness,
simplicity, and obedience at every moment to their
divine Shepherd's voice."
</p>

<p>
He paused; but Isabel made no comment.
</p>

<p>
"In comparing monks with professionals," he said
uneasily, "I know I am putting it on rather a low level."
</p>

<p>
"So I thought," she said.  And with a leap of his
heart, he understood that she was not outside the range
of Christian spirituality.
</p>

<p>
"Then we will put it higher," he continued eagerly.
"Grant for a moment that Christianity is true.  Grant
that the everlasting God, Who carved these hills and
poured out yonder Atlantic, once imprisoned Himself
in space and time and became a mortal man.  Grant
that before He died for us, He begged for our lifelong
love and trust, and for our daily praise and prayer, and
good deeds and obedience and self-denial.  Grant that
He told us how this present life of ours is only a short
road leading into a boundless life to come.  For the
moment you will grant all this?"
</p>

<p>
She bowed her head.
</p>

<p>
"Granting it, what do we find?" he asked.  "We
find the vast majority of men and women, including
those who profess to believe His words, living for
themselves instead of for Him.  'Seven times in a
day have I sung praises unto Thee,' said the Psalmist,
who died so long before our Lord was born; yet
millions of Christians do not truly praise God seven
times in their lives.  They rarely think of Him save
in time of trouble or in the hour of death.  The monk
is a man who throws all his poor weight into the other
scale, striving to redress the balance.  In union with
the one Mediator he prays for those who will not pray.
He offers praises in the stead of those who will not
praise.  The scoffer twits him with his unnatural life;
but it is not more unnatural to give God all one's
thoughts than it is unnatural to give Him none."
</p>

<p>
"Not more unnatural, perhaps," objected Isabel,
"but it is unnatural enough, all the same."
</p>

<p>
"It may be so.  But the monk is born into an
unnatural state of things.  If no man gave God too little,
perhaps we should have no need of monks to give Him
what men call too much.  Perhaps so: perhaps not.
I don't decide.  Some monkish writers have seemed to
say that even if all men were saints it would still be
good for a few to detach themselves from the whirl of
life and to offer God more perfect praises; just as there
have been theologians to teach that, even if man had
not sinned, God would still have been made Man, so as
to perfect our humanity.  But let such subtleties pass."
</p>

<p>
"Whether I agree with it or not, I see what you
mean," said Isabel.  "But is a monk no more than this?"
</p>

<p>
"He is much more," replied Antonio, "so much more
that if we sat here all day we should hardly understand
how much.  But I will mention one thing more.  Not
only do the masses of Christians hold back their love
and service from God; they also outrage His goodness
and dim His glory every hour of every day."
</p>

<p>
"But monks can't mend that matter," protested
Isabel.  "I'm no theologian and I'm a double heretic;
but I've always been told that my right can't atone for
your wrong.  One man can't redeem another."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Antonio, "but one man's prayers may
drive another in penitence to the Redeemer.  'We are
members one of another.'  You love science.  Let me
prophesy.  Science will teach us some day how subtly
mind is intertwined with mind, and how mightily a
thought or an aspiration can leap from one soul to
another.  There is enough of sin and shame in
Christendom to make the angels weep; but God alone knows
how much more there would be if faithful nuns were
not pushing that black bulk back, all night and all day,
with white hands of prayer."
</p>

<p>
Isabel desisted from further debate.  But no sooner
was the stress of argument eased in her brain than a
millstone of fear settled heavily upon her heart.  Up
to that moment she had felt sure of her power as a
living and beautiful woman to triumph over Antonio's
shadowy Bride.  Although his cool greeting had
annoyed her, and although she was still a trifle ruffled
by the affair of the gargoyle and the centipedes, she
had found zest in his monkish coyness.  Like many a
huntress before her she had deemed the quarry's
elusiveness charming so long as she was confident that
in the long run he would be caught.  But, all in a
single moment, her eyes were opened both to the
solemn grandeur of Antonio's religion and to the
startling energy of his whole-hearted, whole-minded belief
in it.  The shadowy Bride suddenly towered like an
impassable, immeasurable, resplendent Jungfrau across
Isabel's path.
</p>

<p>
"I see what you mean," she said hastily, trying to
push back her crowding fears.  "It's interesting, it's
wonderful, I suppose it's beautiful in a kind of way;
but what has it to do with us?  You're not a monk
any longer.  You can't be.  You say it isn't the cowl
that makes the monk; and surely, it isn't mere bricks
and mortar that make a monastery.  The old abbey
down there is an empty shell.  Your Abbot is dead.
Your brethren are dead too, or in perpetual exile.  The
Order has come to an end.  You may play at being a
monk; but you are free."
</p>

<p>
Antonio began to explain the Solemn Vows.  But
she interrupted him scornfully.
</p>

<p>
"Circumstances alter cases," she said.  "Besides,
hadn't you better ask your conscience if you are not
really worshiping your vows, worshiping your
consistency, instead of worshiping God?  God will be
poorly worshiped by making yourself miserable&mdash;yourself
and ... and me."
</p>

<p>
Her voice so softened on the last two syllables that
the monk's lips could not frame an argumentative
retort.  Yet she must be answered.  Although he did
not look at her, he could feel that the irons of her
ordeal were already glowing too hot for her endurance.
Something had to be done.  At last he said:
</p>

<p>
"Without intending it you have told me, a scrap at
a time, the story of your life.  May I tell you the story
of mine?"
</p>

<p>
Her sorrowful eyes lit up gratefully.  "Tell me
every word," she said.
</p>

<p>
In the simplest language he could command, Antonio
told her all.  He began by stating quite baldly the fact
of his noble lineage.  Then he described briefly his
childhood in Lisbon and at Cintra, and his first sight
of an Englishman in the person of a fair-haired young
captain who had been wounded at the battle of Bussaco.
He told of his 'teens in Madeira, and of the drowning
of his parents and sisters on their way thither to join
him; of his appointment to a scandalous sinecure in
the gift of the Government, and of his retreat from
a position which he could do nothing to reform; of
his excursion into French scepticism; of his religious
vocation and of his struggles against it; and of his life
in the monastery up to the day of his ordination to the
priesthood.
</p>

<p>
To the narrating of these events Antonio devoted
barely a quarter of an hour.  When, however, he began
to tell of the monks' expulsion he let himself go;
and thenceforward his warmth of tone and liveliness
of language made Isabel realize vividly every scene he
described.  With kindling eyes he told her of the
dying Abbot's prophecy; of his halt at the deserted
farm on the afternoon of the exodus, and of his
resolve to win back the monastery for Saint Benedict's
family; of his bitter hour in the granary at Navares;
of his tramp northward; of his hard life in Oporto;
of his never-to-be-forgotten months in England and
France and Spain; of his return to the abbey; of his
snub at Villa Branca; of José; of Margarida; and of
young Crowberry's mysterious candle in the
guest-house window.
</p>

<p>
"The rest you know," he said.
</p>

<p>
Throughout his recital he had gazed at the rocks,
the sky, the trees, the water; but, as he ended, he
glanced nervously at Isabel, hungering for her
sympathy yet expecting her scorn.  To his amazement she
slipped from her place at his side, sank down on her
knees beside him, seized both his hands in hers, and
said:
</p>

<p>
"Poor Antonio!  You poor Antonio.  My poor
Antonio!"
</p>

<p>
Her voice was tenderer than a mother's crooning
over a wounded child.  Tears were brimming her eyes
and flowing down her cheeks as she gazed up into the
monk's face.  Then her voice broke.  She bowed her
head abruptly and tried to hide her face in her hands.
But she did not let Antonio's hands go; and her tears
laved the wounds torn by the thorns of her rose.
</p>

<p>
Antonio could have endured her contempt; but this
outburst of a pitying woman's love, the first he had
known for five-and-twenty years, almost broke his
heart.  Thrice he devised words of consolation; thrice
they were stifled in his throat.  He could only sit and
watch the conclusive rise and fall of her shoulders as
the sobbing shook her frame.  Once she controlled
herself enough to look up and moan:
</p>

<p>
"Why, oh why, must we be so unhappy?"
</p>

<p>
The monk knew that an answer was not expected;
so he sat silent.  But later on, when some calmness
had returned to her, she put the question again.
</p>

<p>
"Why must we be so unhappy?  If God can do
everything, why has he made a world that goes so
badly?  Why has he made the easy things sins and
only the hard things virtues?  Why has he made his
creatures so inclined to anger him or forget him?  It
seems mad.  It seems almost diabolical.  I've never
met a wicked man or a foolish woman who could be
foolish enough or wicked enough to make a world like
this if they had the power.  Why is God worse than
we are?"
</p>

<p>
"You do not mean what you say," he answered,
soothing her.  "You know you are not putting it
fairly.  You&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I know, I know," she interrupted.  "I am shallow,
I am unjust, I suppose I'm almost blasphemous.
Forgive me if I've hurt you.  Only, your God is so
terrible.  I believe in Him; but I'm frightened.  He is
nothing but grandeur and majesty.  He will have no
rebellion, He insists on everybody's homage all the
time."
</p>

<p>
"He is Love, everlasting Love," said Antonio
warmly, "and if any words of mine have made you
doubt it, may He forgive me.  I see the world's
unbelief, first and foremost, as Love rejected; and if I
am a monk it is in the hope that my whole life's prayers
may perchance be one poor drop of balm poured into
Love's wounds.  But these matters are too weighty
to be talked of like this.  The origin of evil, the
mystery of free-will&mdash;you have raised the problems that
none can solve."
</p>

<p>
"Let us leave them alone," she pleaded.  "I hate
them.  Deep down in my heart, I do not disbelieve.
Before you had half finished your story, my pride
was broken.  Yes, when you pictured the chapel on
the night you returned, and the moonlight lingering
on the crown of Jesus, I knelt with you in spirit before
that altar and words came back to my lips that I hadn't
said since I was a child."
</p>

<p>
In exceeding thankfulness he was about to speak;
but she hurried on.
</p>

<p>
"Antonio," she said, "if you send me away, perhaps
you will think of me as a temptress&mdash;a woman
raised up by the devil to blandish you aside from your
holy purpose, and to lure you into trampling upon
your vows.  Promise you will never think of me like
that.  Kneeling here on my knees, I swear before
God that I am not ... that."
</p>

<p>
She paused.  Then, with her head bent so that he
could not see her face, and in low tones, she added
slowly:
</p>

<p>
"I have only wanted to be near you&mdash;to be with you,
to spend all the rest of my life listening to you,
helping you.  Heaven knows there has never been for a
moment anything ... anything base in my love.
I know what most people mean by love and I loathe
it.  Tell me you don't misunderstand.  Say you believe
me.  Promise you'll never think of me like that."
</p>

<p>
"I promise," said Antonio, deeply moved.  And, try
as he would, he could say no more.
</p>

<p>
After a long time she raised her head abruptly and
challenged his eyes.  By the pallor which blanched her
cheeks he divined her question, and he knew that the
bitterest moment of his life was come.
</p>

<p>
"So there is no room for me?" she asked in low,
vibrating tones.  "No room for Isabel as well as for
your Bride?  You send me away?"
</p>

<p>
He tried to be cool; but the flame of her pure heart's
yearning so scorched him that he cried out:
</p>

<p>
"No, I do not send you away.  It is not my will; it
is God's.  He knows, Isabel, He knows that all the
sacrifices I have ever made and all the trials I have
ever borne are as a few grains of dust compared with
this.  I do not send you away.  But you must go.
Our spirits are willing to take high and holy vows,
here and now; but we are flesh and we are weak.
You must go.  You must.  You will."
</p>

<p>
She arose slowly and stood upright.  Instantly he
did the same.  He seized her hand; but before he
could speak, she said quietly:
</p>

<p>
"I will go.  After this, unless miracles happen, you
will only see me with Mrs. Baxter or with my father.
But, before I go, do me one little kindness.  I promise
that, so long as I live, it shall be a secret between us.
I know your heart.  Once, only once, let me hear you
say that you love me."
</p>

<p>
Antonio knew that he loved her indeed, with a love
whereof he had no cause to be ashamed, and that he
must speak the three little words she craved.  He
began to frame a prudent preface which should
precisely qualify them and empty them of all their
association with profane passion.  But his knightly blood
stirred in time and saved him.  Besides, he knew that
he might safely speak the words and trust Isabel not
to abuse them.  He bent to her ear and said simply:
</p>

<p>
"I love you."
</p>

<p>
For a long moment she stood with closed eyes and
did not stir.  Then she gently freed her hand and
moved away.  Antonio followed her.  Wherever the
paths were wide enough they walked side by side; but
although the way was long they did not speak.  Here
and there in the wood there were low boughs to be held
aside, and once the monk had to lift her bodily across a
little brook; but he did all these things as a matter of
course, without a word.  When the guest-house
gleamed through the trees, Antonio halted and would
have uttered the few sentences he had been arranging
in his brain; but she silenced him with a gentle gesture
and walked across the broad path, up the sunny steps,
and through the wide-open doorway, without a glance
behind.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0508"></a></p>

<h3>
VIII
</h3>

<p>
Not more than two hours after Antonio's return to his
farm a messenger arrived from the guest-house and
handed in two letters.  The first ran:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>Mrs. Baxter presents her compliments to Signor da
Rocha and begs to request that he will call to-day
without fail, as Mrs. B. is under the unpleasant
obligation of making a painful communication to Signor R.</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The second letter was shorter still.  It contained the
single line:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>I must see you too.</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Antonio's amazement quickly gave place to indignation.
He had examined his conscience concerning the
whole business too often to deceive himself, and he
knew that he was not to blame for what had happened.
Yet here he was, summoned to endure a lecture from
the vulgar Mrs. Baxter.  Worse still, when Sir Percy
came back he would be told the tale.  Antonio would
be regarded ever afterwards as an abuser of a sacred
trust, a heartless trifler with young affections, an
outsider, a brute, a cur fit for the horse-whip.  And he
would have to suffer all this injustice in silence, because
he could only clear himself by disgracing the lady.
</p>

<p>
As he grew cooler the monk became certain that
Isabel had not deliberately betrayed him to
Mrs. Baxter.  Probably she had broken down after her
protracted excitements and had let slip some fatal
admission in a moment of hysteria.  Or perhaps a chattering
servant had seen her walking with Antonio in the
woods.  Gravest possibility of all, some sharp eyes or
ears might have detected her absence in the middle of
the night.  At this last thought he seized his hat and
set out for the guest-house at once.
</p>

<p>
When he reached the road, still soft after the rain,
some hoof-marks reassured him.  He recognized them
as the shoe-prints of Negro, an old post-horse ridden
by the casual letter-carrier of Navares.  News of
some kind had evidently arrived from Sir Percy.
Perhaps he was ill, or dying.  The monk's heart melted
towards Isabel as he perceived that new troubles were
hurrying to smite her, and he would gladly have
submitted to the bitter censures of Mrs. Baxter in their
stead.
</p>

<p>
Isabel met him about fifty yards from the guest-house
door.  She looked more beautiful than ever, but
her expression dismayed him.  No traces lingered of
the exaltation to which she had attained only a few
hours before.  She seemed proud, hard, defiant.
</p>

<p>
"We have heard from my father," she said quickly.
"The unexpected&mdash;I mean the half-expected&mdash;has
happened.  We are to pack and go, as we have packed
and gone from twenty places before.  It isn't azulejos
this time.  It's a railway.  But it'll be all the
same in the end.  He wants us to start for Lisbon the
day after to-morrow.  Mrs. Baxter will tell you everything."
</p>

<p>
To Antonio's surprise she neither referred to her
note nor said a word on her personal account, but led
him straight into the salon where Mrs. Baxter was
seated in the midst of confusion.  Isabel's pictures
had already been removed from the walls, and Jackson
could be heard in a back-room nailing down a packing-case.
The noises fell on Antonio's heart like blows on
a coffin-lid.
</p>

<p>
"I have learned, Madame, with concern, that you
are compelled to undertake a fatiguing journey," said
Antonio in his most formal style.  "Let me repeat my
assurance that I remain, at all times, entirely at your
service."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure you do, Signor, I'm sure you do," wailed
Mrs. Baxter.  "But tell me, Signor, what do you think
of it all?  I was saying, only this morning, how
comforting it was that we were settled for life, and how
delightful it would be to spend the rest of my days in
the salubrious air of this favored spot, enlivened by
the profitable conversation of a congenial neighbor."
</p>

<p>
Isabel listened to her governess with a scornful lip.
What Mrs. Baxter had really said, only that morning,
was that she had determined to write Sir Percy her
mind at once; that, through the almost incredible
deficiencies of the village shops and the unscriptural
errors of Joanninha, she was being starved and
poisoned, both in body and soul; that she had never
stayed in such a hole before, and never meant to again;
that, after enjoying the intimacy of some of the first
personages in England, she found it intolerable to
have only one neighbor, especially when he was only
a small yeoman with no table-napkins and not enough
forks to go round; and, finally, that she flatly declined
to remain after Christmas in any Portuguese place
save Lisbon or Oporto.
</p>

<p>
"The Senhora does me too much honor," said Antonio,
without enthusiasm.  "But this is not final?
The Senhoras will return?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir Percival Kaye-Templeman never returns anywhere,"
snapped Mrs. Baxter, "I declare, Signor, that
he drags me about like a slave.  If it hadn't been for
my death-bed promise to the sainted mother of that
darling child sitting on the blue ottoman, I should have
left him a thousand times."
</p>

<p>
The darling child arose from the blue ottoman and
went to an escritoire.  She opened a drawer and took
something from it.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Baxter is forgetting to give you my father's
letter," she said.  "He tells us he has written to thank
you for all you have done."
</p>

<p>
Antonio received the sealed letter into his hand;
and, as neither of the ladies proffered him leave to read
it in their presence, he placed it in his breast-pocket.
</p>

<p>
"For the present my father also begs you to take
the keys of the abbey," added Isabel.  "Here they are.
He says he has explained everything in his letter.  As
for this guest-house, there are only two keys.  We will
give them to you when we go, on Thursday."
</p>

<p>
Antonio's heart leaped like a bird at her words about
the abbey keys; but it sank like a stone as she said,
"we go on Thursday."  So violent was his agitation
that, to cover it, he rose from his seat and advanced
to the open drawer of the escritoire where the keys
were lying.  He dared not look at Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"If the chapel key is not here," she said, in an
off-hand way, "you know where to find it."
</p>

<p>
She placed the bunch in his hand.  There were
about twenty keys, great and small, bright and dull,
and they tinkled together pleasantly as Antonio
carried them back to his place.  But they sounded in his
ears more like a far-heard knell than a merry chime.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you must go now?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
"My pet, my darling pet," expostulated Mrs. Baxter,
looking daggers.  "What on earth will Signor de
Rocha think?  He'll think you want to hunt him out
of the house."
</p>

<p>
"So I do.  There's a waterfall somewhere in the
grounds.  I want him, if he has time, to show me the
way to it.  A waterfall and stepping-stones.  Perhaps,
Mrs. Baxter, you will come with us."
</p>

<p>
"Stepping-stones!" gasped Mrs. Baxter.  "Not if
they were made of solid gold.  Not if you paid me a
million pounds.  Why, you've quite forgotten, Isabel,
darling, that if it hadn't been for stepping-stones, poor
little Lady Margaret Barricott would be alive to-day!"
</p>

<p>
"Then you won't come?  Senhor da Rocha, have
you really the leisure to take me?"
</p>

<p>
"I have the leisure," answered Antonio formally.
"And, if I had not, leisure should be made.  Mrs. Baxter,
I will send up my man to-morrow to assist you
in the packing of your goods, and I will certainly
attend you on Thursday.  Meanwhile, I am your
obedient servant."
</p>

<p>
Isabel was already in the ante-chamber and Antonio
did not overtake her until she was descending the
steps.  Dangling the keys he walked beside her without
speech until they reached the shelter of the trees.
Then he drew from his pocket the long steel key of the
chapel and halted a moment while he placed it among
the others.
</p>

<p>
"You see that I had brought it," he said.  "This
morning I forgot to give it you."
</p>

<p>
"Pray don't explain," she commanded curtly.
"We've had explanations enough and to spare."
</p>

<p>
He relocked the old-fashioned key-ring and they
resumed their march, Isabel going first along the narrow
path.  Antonio felt thankful for the short respite from
talk.  He knew that he was on his way to the sharpest
fight of all.  Although there was nothing of love in
Isabel's manner towards him, he divined that she had
invited him to the cascade in order to overthrow him
by some final argument or appeal.
</p>

<p>
Could he be sure that he would once more succeed
in resistance?  He took stock of his weapons and
forces.  In sheer dialectic he knew that he was Isabel's
match; for the very slowness of his English gave him
a certain advantage.  Nor was he greatly her inferior
in rhetorical resource.  What he feared was Isabel's
unconscious challenging of his chivalry.  He did not
dread the wiles of deliberate coquetry, even if she had
been capable of practicing them; and, most emphatically,
he did not dread the seductiveness of her physical
charms, because the stern battle against the flesh
was a battle he had fought and won long years before.
But he dreaded, with a dread nearly driving him into
cowardice, the hateful task of bringing hot tears into
her cool blue eyes and of breaking her soft voice into
heart-broken sobbings.
</p>

<p>
He glanced at Isabel as she pressed onward a yard
or so ahead.  As always, she was the soul and body of
grace.  The poise of her golden head upon her
swan-white neck, her proud shoulders, her exquisite waist,
her fine hands plucking at the autumn leaves, her little
feet which seemed hardly to touch the earth&mdash;all these
charms were as adorable as ever.  Yet there was
something unusual in her port and gait.  Perhaps she
was less willowy, more rigid.  She advanced with a
masterful air as if to say: "To-day there shall be no
nonsense.  I lead: you follow.  You are mine to do
as I please with.  Until this afternoon I have indulged
you as I might indulge a favorite young horse.  I've
let you just smell the halter and then go galloping off
to the other end of the field.  I've let you lead me a
breathless dance through the buttercups and clover.
But you have bucked and jibbed and bolted and
neighed and tossed up your head and shaken out your
mane and tail long enough.  This time I mean to put
the halter on.  So let there be no mistake about it."
</p>

<p>
Antonio observed all this and was thankful.  So
long as she chose to be peremptory, scornful, logical,
he was safe.  The encounter, though painful, would
not be perilous.  But let her once soften and he was
lost.  He felt that, even with the remains of yesterday's
miraculous grace in his heart, he would be powerless
against a tear or a sob.  His two sleepless nights
and the unwonted stress of romantic emotions were
wearing him down, and he inwardly prayed that he
might not be tempted beyond what he would bear.
</p>

<p>
When she reached the pool, Isabel did not cross the
stepping-stones.  Halting some distance from the
brawling waterfall, and hardly waiting for Antonio to
approach her, she began:
</p>

<p>
"We have had many long talks at this pool.
To-day's talk will be short.  Surely I have crawled to
you enough on my hands and knees, and I will do it
no more."
</p>

<p>
Antonio said nothing.
</p>

<p>
"There's not an hour to lose," she went on.  "If
you and I are going to do the right thing, I must tell
Mrs. Baxter to stop the packing at once.  You jump!
You turn pale.  I suppose you're shocked to hear me
call it the right thing.  I can't help it.  I must speak
the truth.  It is the right thing.  And the opposite
thing is not only wrong; it's wicked, it's blasphemous,
it's a crime.  No.  Don't interrupt me.  You
needn't think we're going over all the old, old
arguments again."
</p>

<p>
"You have changed your mind rather swiftly," said
Antonio, refusing to be suppressed.  "Barely four
hours ago you seemed to acquiesce in&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"In my fate," she said, with a bitter laugh.  "So I
did.  You worked on my feelings.  Don't think me
coarse and brutal; but I'll give you one illustration.
You spread for me your cloak.  Do you think I didn't
see how old it was?  When I thought of that, and of
all the hardships you'd suffered, my heart broke and
I cried and cried and cried like a baby.  But I've
changed my mind.  I admire you as much as ever;
but I don't admire the way you are going on.  A man
like you ought to have the best cloak in the world, and
all the rest of the best things with it.  You are a poet,
you are a delicate gentleman.  I see it every time you
pour out a drop of wine or touch a flower.  You
would rejoice in exquisite things more than any
woman."
</p>

<p>
"Shall I offend you, Isabel?" he asked, coloring up,
"if I remind you that this talk is to be short?  We are
not getting on."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we are getting on fast," she retorted.  "I say
that I hate the way you are living.  To save money
and to buy back this place for the Benedictines is all
very well; but I say that your sacrifices are overdone,
and that God must be grieved by your excesses.  He
has shown that you are not meant to be a monk.  He
has driven your brethren away, and instead of them
he has sent you ... <i>me</i>.  No.  I'm not conceited.
I don't think I'm wonderful.  But I'm your
destiny, and that's everything.  You were not called
to monasticism; you were called to <i>me</i>.  That is, you
were called to be a monk only to save you from the
wrong woman, only until the appointed day should
dawn for you and me to meet.  It has dawned.  Yes,
Antonio, I can quote Scripture, and I don't quote it
irreverently either.  The day has dawned.  And 'To-day
if ye will hear His voice, harden not your heart.'  If
you do, it will be a sin; just as I suppose it's a sin
for a man to harden his heart against the call to be a
monk."
</p>

<p>
"No more of this, I pray," cried Antonio.  "If
there is some great new fact, let us have it; but let
us not hark back to what we have threshed out already."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," she said.  "Here is the great new fact.
My father.  What did I tell you about him?  I told
you that his next experiment will kill him.  But
there's only one way of snatching him out of peril.
Pardon me for telling you that this abbey is mine.  It
was bought with my money, and I am, to some extent,
mistress of my father's movements in Portugal.  If I
flatly decline to leave here; if I pension off Mrs. Baxter;
and if ... if you do what is right by yourself
and by me; then, and only then, will my father
come down from the clouds and look facts in the face.
If I go back to Lisbon, I go back to kill him."
</p>

<p>
Deeply pained, Antonio raised a hand to stop her.
She took a step forward and looked at him with steady
eyes, but with trembling lips.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think, do you truly believe, that I would
say a thing like this if it were not true?" she demanded
in low, quivering tones.  "Oh, Antonio, I have always
known it.  In your heart you despise me.  You think
I'm so far sunk in shamelessness that I am taking the
name of God in vain and concocting lies about my
father's life, so as to scare you into marrying me."
</p>

<p>
"Before Heaven, Isabel, I think no such foul
thought," he answered solemnly.  "But I am puzzled.
If this abbey is yours, not his; and if you are mistress
of his movements; why not assert your authority
without dragging in me?  Why not pension off
Mrs. Baxter and get a companion from England?  Why
not despatch a post to Lisbon to-night informing your
father that you will be no party to his new scheme,
and that you insist on his recruiting quietly here?"
</p>

<p>
"And you?" she demanded.
</p>

<p>
"I?  No doubt we should meet sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"No doubt, no doubt," she echoed with scorching
scorn.  "We should meet sometimes, and talk about
the weather.  You nearly make me hate you.  Have
you blood in your veins or water?  Have you a heart
in your breast or a cold stone?  I tell you this is a
crime, it is a blasphemy.  You call it religion: I call it
a black sin against God."
</p>

<p>
Her terrible earnestness challenged Antonio to
answer once and for all.
</p>

<p>
"Isabel," he said sternly.  "Crime and blasphemy
are hard words.  You speak of God.  I will speak of
God too.  If there is one thing I am sure of, it is that
God has called me to live this life which I am living,
and to do this work which I am doing.  I am more
sure of it than I am of these rocks under our feet.  As
for your father, God knows that I do not speak
heartlessly; but your father's life is in God's hands, not
mine.  You can rid yourself of Mrs. Baxter and compel
him to rest in England without forcing me to break
my vows."
</p>

<p>
"Your vows, your precious vows, always your
vows!" she cried, in anger and great contempt.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he retorted instantly, "my vows, always my
vows.  They are precious to me indeed, and I will beg
you not to speak of them lightly."
</p>

<p>
She faced him with increasing anger.  But, before
she could speak, Antonio suddenly repented himself of
his sharpness.
</p>

<p>
"Isabel," he said, in quieter tones.  "Think.  You
despise me for keeping my vows.  But suppose I had
vowed my vows to you.  And suppose I should break
them, for some other woman.  What then?"
</p>

<p>
"I would kill her.  And you too."
</p>

<p>
For a moment her wrathful excitement hindered her
logical perceptions; but as soon as she recognized his
meaning she cried:
</p>

<p>
"It's different, all different!  I'm real; your Bride
isn't.  Besides, She has deserted you.  She's run
away, or She's dead.  You are free."
</p>

<p>
"No, Isabel," he said.  "Think again.  Suppose
to-day I should vow my vow to you.  Suppose your
father, or someone else, should pluck you suddenly
from my side so that I could never find you again.
Nay, more.  Suppose you were untrue to me and that
you abandoned me.  Would you have me say: 'She
has gone.  I shall never see her again.  To-morrow I
will seek another bride?'  No, Isabel, no.  If you say
Yes, I shan't believe it.  I know your soul too well.
Even if you broke yours, my vow would still be there,
and you would despise me for not keeping it.  Am I
right or wrong?"
</p>

<p>
He had unguardedly lowered his tones to a perilous
tenderness, and he was unconsciously gazing at her
with the gaze she could never resist.  Her lips lost
their hardness and began to tremble, and her eyelids
drooped over her eyes.
</p>

<p>
Antonio involuntarily recoiled from the danger.  He
knew in an instant that his fate was quivering in the
balance.  His heart had bled at every harsh word he
spoke to her; and he knew that to sweep away the
last shaken ruins of his defenses, she needed only to
throw herself weeping into his arms.  He knew that if
she should once sob out, "Antonio, Antonio, don't send
me away," his doom would then and there be sealed.
</p>

<p>
All this Antonio knew.  But Isabel did not know it.
His sudden movement of recoil stung her back into
anger.
</p>

<p>
"Are you right or wrong?" she echoed bitterly.
"You're right, of course.  You always are.  Even
when you're wrong fifty times over, you can argue
yourself into the right.  I call it cowardly."
</p>

<p>
He exhaled a deep breath.  The peril was past.
Her scorn he could withstand.
</p>

<p>
"I have come to the end," she cried.  "The very
end.  Listen.  You are blighting my life, but I won't
let you blight your own.  Mark me well.  This place
is mine.  These lands are mine.  I have the right to go
to-night and to set the whole abbey ablaze; and where
will your work be then?"
</p>

<p>
The threat did not alarm him; but the cruelty of it,
coming from such lips as hers, cut him to the marrow.
He was on the point of retorting that the place was not
hers at all, and that her father had deceived her on a
wretched point of money.  But her anguish was bitter
enough without this new mortification; so he held his
peace.
</p>

<p>
"I can make a bonfire of it this minute," she went on
passionately.  "I hate it.  How I should love to see it
blaze!  But I won't.  And I won't sell this place.
And when I've left it on Thursday, I'll never come
back till you seek me on your knees.  Never!"
</p>

<p>
Still Antonio held his peace.  Isabel picked up her
little bag.  But she did not turn immediately towards
home.  She stood awaiting his final word.  When it
failed to come her indignation rose to its climax.
</p>

<p>
"No!" she cried.  "I've altered my mind.  I will
come back.  I foresee the end.  You will never seek
me.  You hate me.  But I will come back.  You'll go
on slaving, slaving, starving, starving, praying,
praying, and breaking hearts in the name of God.  But I
will come back.  You'll succeed.  You'll regain the
abbey.  You'll fill it with monks.  But remember.  I
will come back.  On the day of your triumph, I will be
there.  It isn't only you Southern people who love
revenge.  I will be there.  I will come back!"
</p>

<p>
Antonio had been silently praying for sudden grace
in his own dire need; but he ceased to pray for himself
and prayed with all his soul for her.  She turned to go.
</p>

<p>
They stood facing one another as they had stood so
often during these two bitter days of their ordeal.
Try as he would the monk could not conceal his agony
of holy love; and under the spell of his gaze the devil
of revengeful hate which had entered into Isabel rent
her poor heart and fled away.  They looked at each
other a long time.  Then, in a breaking voice, she said
softly:
</p>

<p>
"Antonio.  I don't hate you.  I love you.  This is
the very last time.  Do you send Isabel away?  Is it
true that I must go?"
</p>

<p>
With a sharp moan of anguish and with hands
thrust out for mercy he gave his answer.
</p>

<p>
"For the love of Jesus Christ," he cried.  "Go!
And may the merciful God help us both!"
</p>

<p>
He closed his eyes in desperate prayer.  But God
and the Virgin Mother and the whole company of
heaven seemed to have forsaken him.  No light shown,
no supernal fortitude came down.  Instead of a vision
of ministering angels, his mind's eyes saw only Isabel.
Isabel, standing there.  Isabel, weeping.  Isabel,
wounded to death by his cruel sword.  Isabel, hoping
against hope for his mercy.  Isabel, his Isabel, rarer
than gold, lovelier than the dawn, purer than snow,
waiting to dart like a bird into the nest of his love.
</p>

<p>
He could fight no longer.  Stepping one staggering
step forward he held out his arms and opened his
eyes.
</p>

<p>
She had vanished.
</p>

<p>
A moment later he caught sight of her pressing up
the path above him.  She was going swiftly, looking
neither to the right hand nor to the left.  Now and
again a ray of the sinking sun shone upon her hair,
till she seemed a queen crowned or a saint glorified.
</p>

<p>
With all his heart Antonio yearned to leap after her,
to capture her like a shy creature of the woods, and to
bear her back in triumph, seated on his shoulder as she
had sat after the thunderstorm.  But his limbs refused
to obey.  His feet seemed to have been rooted for
centuries in the granite.  He could not move an inch.
</p>

<p>
Two cypresses, which they had often halted to admire,
hid her from his sight.  A groan, which he could
not stifle, broke from the monk.  There was one more
point in the path, one only, where she could reappear.
Would she turn round?  Would she look back?  As
he waited, red-hot pincers seemed to be working and
worming within him as if they would have his heart
out of his body.  He felt as if he were bleeding at
every pore.
</p>

<p>
She reappeared.  She did not turn round.  She did
not look back.  She was gone.

I
</h3>

<p>
Having charged José to place himself at the disposal
of Mrs. Baxter, Antonio took the road for Villa Branca
about an hour after sunrise.  Utter weariness had
brought a few hours' sleep to his eyelids; but he felt
unrested and unrefreshed.  By the time he reached
Santa Iria fatigue compelled him to hire a horse.
</p>

<p>
While his mount was a-saddling the monk sat musing
outside the wine-shop.  What was Isabel doing?
Of what was she thinking?  Had she slept?  Was
she truly hating him at last?  Would she come once
more to the cascade?
</p>

<p>
In answer to this last question he could hardly
restrain himself from leaping on the half-ready horse and
galloping off like a whirlwind to her presence.  At the
moment of his leaving the farm-house, two hours
before, this all-day expedition to Villa Branca had
seemed the height of prudence; but he suddenly saw
it as the depth of cowardice and brutality.  She would
come to the cascade, in vain; and, later on, she would
learn from José's lips how he had turned tail and run
away.  Antonio cringed and burned.  A moment
later, however, he knew that he had done right.  She
would not be at the cascade.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow," he said to himself, with a dull pain
gnawing in his cold and heavy heart, "I shall see her
for the last time.  She will make no sign.  She will
say good-bye as if there has been nothing between us.
Blessed Mother of God, help us to the end!"
</p>

<p>
He took out Sir Percy's letter and perused it once
more to distract his thoughts.  He read:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>Dear Senhor da Rocha,&mdash;</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>A post just to hand apprises me of your gentility to
my daughter and her governess.  The fact that I fully
expected such courteous behavior on your part does
not diminish my gratitude in respect of it; and I beg
you to believe in the sincerity of my regret that I shall
be unable to present my acknowledgments in person.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>I indulge the hope that a proposal which I am about
to make may not be unacceptable to you.  From our
mutual friend Mr. Austin Crowberry I learn that you
wished to purchase the abbey domain, but that your
offers were unacceptable to the Minister of Finances.</i>

<i>I have paid a deposit of £500 to the chief of the
Fazenda at Villa Branca, and am engaged to pay £300
on New Year's Day and the balance (£2500) in five
half-yearly instalments.  As I have become closely
associated with an enterprise which will involve my
residing alternately in Lisbon and London, I should find
it convenient to transfer to yourself my whole bargain
as regards the abbey.  That is to say, I forfeit the £500
already paid and leave you to find £2800 on the dates
above referred to.  I also ask your acceptance of the
larger articles of English furniture recently placed by
me in the guest-house, and I have instructed Jackson,
my man, to bring away personal luggage only.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>As my movements are erratic, perhaps you will
indulge me by completing the business with my agents,
Messrs. Lemos Monteiro and Smithson, Rua do
Carmo, Lisbon, who have written to Villa Branca
preparing the officials for your visit.  Failing your
approval I will make other arrangements; but,
meanwhile, I beg that you will add to your unfailing
kindness by taking care of the keys, and that you will
believe me to be</i>

<p>
Once in the saddle, with the well-beloved music of
horse-hoofs in his ears, Antonio found it easier to
abstract his mind from bitter thoughts.  He applied his
whole brain to problems of finance.  Two thousand
five hundred pounds in two years and a half.  At
first it had staggered him; but he was going to take
the risk.  His own and José's hard cash hoardings
would pay the New Year's Day instalment nearly twice
over.  By mortgaging the farm and the sea-sand vineyards,
and by pledging his personal credit he could pay
the July five hundred and keep two or three hundred
towards the instalment due the following January,
making up the balance from the year's wine-sales.
Fifteen hundred pounds would remain payable; and
this sum he hoped to raise in due course by a bold
stroke involving a mortgage on the abbey itself.
</p>

<p>
The chief of the Fazenda received his visitor
effusively.  This time the monk was not required to lean
against a pile of stolen books.  He sat in the chief's
own chair and was offered wine of the chief's own
stealing.  As three hundred pounds of Isabel's money
had stuck to the chief's fingers the great man was more
than willing to accept Antonio in Sir Percy's place; for
he had just learned that the Englishman would be
unable to meet his obligations, and he was mortally
afraid of a reopening of the transaction in Lisbon.
He even threw out mysterious hints as to further
concessions which might be arranged.  Antonio listened
attentively.  His conscience allowed him to plan the
outwitting of the Portuguese Government as regards
money which was not honestly theirs.  But as soon as
he perceived that the official was bent on more
pickings for himself the monk became obtuse.  He was not
willing to assist any man in the work of more
completely damning his soul; and, although Antonio
clearly foresaw that he was making an enemy and
preparing sore troubles for himself in the future, he
steadfastly held out against temptation.
</p>

<p>
The autumn day was drawing to its twilight when
Antonio, having given up his horse at Santa Iria,
trudged up the path to his own door.  Half the way
home Isabel had queened his whole mind.  On leaving
Villa Branca he had sought to preoccupy himself with
the most complicated arithmetic; but, little by little,
Isabel had reclaimed her empire.  As he mounted the
doorstep his heart thumped heavily.  Had she written?
Had she sent a message by José?  Or, most terrible
and beautiful possibility of all, would he find her sitting
in the house, as in her rightful place?
</p>

<p>
He entered.  There was no Isabel enlightening the
dim and cheerless room.  He hurried to the table
whereon, José was accustomed to leave the letters.
There was nothing.  His heart chilled and shrank.
Still, there was to-morrow.  Yes.  He was certain to
see her to-morrow.
</p>

<p>
José stamped in noisily and handed Antonio two keys.
</p>

<p>
"They have gone," he said.
</p>

<p>
So sharp a blade of anguish pierced his soul that
Antonio let the keys fall on the brick floor.
</p>

<p>
"Gone?" he echoed.  "Who?  When?  Why?  Where?"
</p>

<p>
"The English senhoras," answered José.  "They
started about three o'clock, to Lisbon."
</p>

<p>
Antonio sank down upon a coffer.  He had used up
the last of his strength in tramping from Santa Iria,
and he had eaten nothing all day.
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand it very well," continued José.
"I reached the guest-house at half-past eight.  I
thought they weren't to leave until to-morrow.  I
worked under the Senhor Jaxo.  He didn't hurry
himself at all.  Joanninha brought us cold meat and
white bread and strong wine.  Joanninha is the cook.
She has the longest tongue, your Worship, in Portugal.
She made me angry, talking about your Worship."
</p>

<p>
"About me?  How?" asked Antonio.  He felt sick
and faint.
</p>

<p>
"She heard me say that your Worship would attend
the senhoras to-morrow morning.  She said: 'Where
is his Excellency to-day?  I suppose he's gone to see
Senhor Jorge's Margarida.'  I said: 'No, his Worship
has something better to do.  He has gone to Villa
Branca to mind his own business, and it would be a
good thing if everybody else would do the same.'  There
was an English servant in the room, called Ficha.
She's maid to the Senhorita Isabel.  Joanninha
translated to her what I'd said, and they both laughed, and
I was very angry."
</p>

<p>
"What has this to do with the senhoras going away
in such a hurry?" asked Antonio.  But, even as he
finished putting the question, his own fears supplied the
answer.
</p>

<p>
"It's nothing to do with the senhoras hurrying away
at all," said José humbly.  "I beg your Worship's
pardon for repeating such nonsense.  All I know is that
some bells rang and the Senhor Jaxo went out, and
when he came back he was in a great rage.  Joanninha
told me that the Senhorita Isabel had decided to go to
her illustrious father at once, and that nobody dared
oppose her."
</p>

<p>
"Did you see the senhoras?  Were they well?"
</p>

<p>
"I think they were well, because I heard them
quarreling," José answered.  "The dark senhora, the
old one, has a temper that made me tremble, your
Worship.  They went away, the senhoras and the
servants in two old shut-up carriages, but they are
going to hire a better carriage on the way.  I saw the
old senhora, when she handed me the keys.  She sent
you a long message, but I don't think Joanninha could
translate it properly.  So I asked would she write, but
she didn't.  They locked all up and gave me the keys.
Then they went away.  They didn't say when they
will come back.  I think, your Worship, that they are
all mad."
</p>

<p>
"José," said his master, after a long silence, "I have
eaten nothing all day.  Let me break my fast.  Afterwards
I have something to tell you.  Prepare me what
you can while I change my clothes."
</p>

<p>
He climbed the steep and narrow stairs painfully.
His cold tub revived him, and his old clothes gave him
ease.  But, as he lifted his worn cloak from its hook,
the wound in his heart burst open afresh.  He remembered
how often Isabel had sat, in all her daintiness,
upon that same cloak's clean but rusty folds; and how,
on her own confession, she had "cried and cried and
cried like a baby" at the sight of its threadbareness.
</p>

<p>
By the time he descended José had grilled two small
trout and was placing a bottle of good white wine upon
the table.  Antonio's heart was wrung anew at the
thought of the simple fellow's unfailing devotion.
Isabel had come and had gone; but José remained,
loving and serving his strange master with a dumb
love passing the love of women.  The monk forced
his faithful disciple to sit down at table with him and
to take his fair share of the dainty fish and the
animating wine.  When they had finished eating and
drinking he said:
</p>

<p>
"José, I have been a good deal in and about the
guest-house and the abbey since we saved the azulejos,
and many strange things have happened.  The end of
it all is this.  Here are the keys of the guest-house.
Upstairs, in the green box, I have all the keys of the
abbey.  To-day, as you know, I have been to Villa
Branca.  We are in legal possession of the abbey
domain, and everything in it.  Within three years we
must raise three thousand pounds.  With God's help
it can be done.  The English people will never come
back."
</p>

<p>
He closed his eyes wearily.  When he half-opened
them he saw José by the light of the one candle, bowing
his head and silently repeating thankful prayers.  The
monk quailed.  For himself, as well as for José, this
ought to be a night of praise and rejoicing.  Yet
Antonio found it the darkest hour of his life.  The
abbey keys seemed no more than a few bits of metal.
Or, if they were more than bits of metal, they were
the keys of a prison, the keys which were locking
Isabel outside his life.
</p>

<p>
He took his candle and went to bed.  But, despite
his weariness, he could not sleep.  Where was she?
In what rough inn, amidst what discomforts and
indignities, was she lying?  If he jumped up at once
and tramped southward until he could find a horse,
when would he overtake her?  To-morrow, he calculated,
about noon.  He imagined himself thundering
after her chariot, like a highwayman in a picture.
He pictured her pretty alarm, her radiant joy, her
gracious forgiveness, their ecstasy of reunion.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the monk remembered with a shock that
he had not said all his Office.  Busy or idle, sick or
well, glad or sad, he had never failed to recite it before.
He still had None, Vespers, and Compline to say.
Lighting the candle and opening his breviary he began
to repeat the holy words.  But he had not uttered half
a dozen sentences before he shut the book with a snap.
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later he arose, put together all the keys,
and went down stairs.  The new moon had not set,
and its brightness lured him forth from his narrow
room into the peace of the night.  As a matter of
course he took the path to the abbey.
</p>

<p>
Although the ruts of wheels, her wheels, made him
shiver he did not turn back.  He opened the chapel
with the long key she had so often handled, and sitting
down in his old stall, he tried to say the rest of None;
but a white form, her form, hindered him, and a
soft, glad voice, her voice, cried: "Antonio,
Antonio, Antonio&mdash;what a beautiful name!"  He groped
his way to his own cell, and he could almost see and
hear her opening his cupboards.  He hastened through
the cloisters and escaped into the wood by the secret
door.
</p>

<p>
Some dead leaves fled before him, their tripping
sound was no lighter than the fall of her elfin feet.
The moon suddenly peeped at him through a
clearing; and he saw her moon-white shoulders.  The
chirrup of a brimming brook struck upon his ear;
and he seemed to be carrying her once more in his
arms, while she murmured: "Listen, Antonio, all the
world is singing."
</p>

<p>
He knew that the guest-house must tear his wound
wide open, and that he ought to hurry home to the
farm; but an irresistible influence drew him on.  He
reached the broad path.  He stood under the casement
whence she had flung the white rose.  It was still ajar.
</p>

<p>
He turned the key in the lock and entered the ghostly
and silent house.  There was enough moonlight in the
salon to show him the blue ottoman whereon she had
so often sat.  He hurried out of the room with a heart
ready to burst.
</p>

<p>
At the foot of the stairs he paused.  They led to
her chamber.  Could he bear to cross its threshold,
to lean out of the window as she had leaned out after
the thunder, and to look at the bed where she had
lain sobbing for his sake?  He knew he could not
bear it.  But his intellect had ceased to govern him
and he ascended the stairs.
</p>

<p>
A broad moonbeam lit up every corner of her
chamber.  Like a man dazed he lurched to the window.
There were the roses and there were the thorns.  He
turned to gaze at her couch.  The fine linen had been
taken away; but there was the place where she had
lain, there was the pillow which her golden head had
pressed.  What had her last night been?  Had she
hated him or did she love him still?  Had she cursed
God or had she prayed?
</p>

<p>
For a moment his mind turned the question over in
a numb, impersonal way.  Then he came back with a
rush to himself and, in a single moment, his chalice of
agony welled up and brimmed over.  He flung himself
down on his knees and stretched out desperate
hands and hungry arms across the narrow bed.
</p>

<p>
Although long minutes passed his dry-eyed, stony
anguish remained.  But at last his inward, spiritual
man spoke.  Was he committing a grievous sin?
Was he breaking, in spirit, a vow which he was only
keeping in the letter?  Had he forsaken the Creator
for a creature?
</p>

<p>
Slowly, but very surely, his conscience framed
the answer.  No, he had not sinned.  In all his desire
of her there was still nothing of the carnal mind.  He
was racked and scorched by anguish, not because he
had lost her love, but because he had been forced to
break her heart by refusing her his own.  She was a
child, a poor lonely child with neither man nor woman
to love her, nor any God to console her; and he, Antonio,
had flung her back into a still blacker frost and
sharper famine, to pine and wither without love and
without faith.  Yet, in all this, he had simply obeyed
God.  He had obeyed the God who commanded
Abram to offer up Isaac, the God who "spared not His
own Son, but freely gave Him up for us all."
</p>

<p>
The moonbeam softly faded from the chamber.
But Antonio did not move.  His weary limbs and
exhausted brain could resist no longer; and, still kneeling
against her pillow with his arms outstretched across
her bed, he fell asleep.
</p>

<h3>
II
</h3>

<p>
When the monk awoke day was dawning.  For a
while memory failed him.  But as soon as he understood
that he was in Isabel's room he leaped up and
hastened downstairs.
</p>

<p>
He knew that he ought to go straight home.  But
his feet, despite their soreness, turned towards the
stepping-stones.  He retraced the path by which she
had left him, hardly thirty-six hours before.  Past the
cypresses, through the mimosas, he went; and before
the sun rose he was standing in the icy spray of the
thunderous waterfall.  He longed to plunge into the
crystal pool; but her invisible presence abashed him,
and with an ever-sharpening pain he hurried away.
</p>

<p>
As he regained the farm, he found José burning
some dead leaves.  Why could he not tear down these
clinging memories of Isabel from his heart, as José
could tear down ivies from the trees, and fling them
a-top of the glowing, fuming pyre?  The gust of pale,
acrid smoke which nipped his nostrils was bitter-sweet.
</p>

<p>
After a dip in the brook he drank some of the sham
coffee and forced down a hunk of coarse bread.  But
when he faced his routine he found that he could
neither work nor pray.  The black and red letters in
his breviary danced impishly before his eyes; and when
he took up a pen to write out some accounts he
marked the paper with more blots than figures.  Both
door and window were wide open to the morning
breeze; yet the room suffocated him.
</p>

<p>
At last a plan formed in Antonio's brain and he did
not delay its execution.  Stuffing a piece of bread in
his pocket he sought out José and said:
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow my hard work will begin.  To-day I
am going to Navares.  After to-night I will not leave
you so much alone."
</p>

<p>
He set out, striding northward with long strides.
Every stride was a symbol of his renunciation; for he
knew that by this time Isabel would have left her inn
and that every moment was taking her farther
southward to Lisbon.  On he pressed.  As landmark after
landmark came in sight a flood of old memories
diluted his bitter potion of new-brewed sorrow.  He
lived over again the afternoon of his dusty march
from the monastery amid a throng of monks and soldiers
and the evening of his solitary return.  But not
for long.  An hour before the white houses of
Navares shone in the morning sun Isabel had once
more become the sole tenant of his mind.
</p>

<p>
The doors of the Navares' corn-factor's granary,
where the monks had held their council, were wide
open; but Antonio did not pause to look inside.  As
on the night of his flight, he hurried through the town
and only rested when he came to the knoll where he
had bivouacked twice before.  Thence, after
munching a little bread, he took the short cut through the
maize-fields to the village of the old cura; for the old
cura's grave was the goal of his hasty pilgrimage.
</p>

<p>
By an irony of fate a rustic wedding had drawn the
whole population to the church and churchyard.
Their mirth so mocked the pilgrim's mood that he
had a mind to go away.  But he mixed with the
throngs until his resentment at their gaiety was turned
to thankfulness for the excess of human joy over
human sorrow.  At last a horn was blown from the
door of a neighboring barn, and the crowd swept out
of the churchyard like stampeding buffaloes.
</p>

<p>
The plain grave of the old cura lay in a sheltered
corner on the north side of the chancel.  Pious hands
had brightened it with a yellow and purple nosegay
that very morning.  Antonio did not kneel down.
He simply uncovered his head and strove to pray.
For five minutes it was like chewing chaff.  Some
devil whispered in the monk's ear that his errand was
not only silly, but in doubtful taste.  The old cura was
a saint, no doubt; but what had so rough a diamond
to do with so soft and lustrous and exquisite a pearl as
Isabel?  Thus spake the devil, but Antonio refused
his ear.  Knowing that prayer comes with praying, he
prayed on.
</p>

<p>
Not until he had replaced his hat on his head and
was about to go were his prayers answered.  But when
the answer came, it was an answer indeed.  It almost
struck him down, like the great light which struck
down Saul on the way to Damascus, and he was forced
to lean against the church wall.  It was an answer
which both healed the worst of his grief and showed
him the most of his duty in a single flash.  It thrust
into his hand a golden key to the whole mystery of
Isabel, past and future.
</p>

<p>
Like a man whose shoulders have suddenly been
eased of a burden he swung out homewards, holding
his head high.  Without knowing it, he talked to
himself aloud, uttering broken phrases of hope and
thankfulness.  Yes, he had found the key, the master-key
to all that had happened.  As he strode along he
recalled his association with Isabel from the
beginning, and there was no lock his key did not fit.
</p>

<p>
Even the problem which had tried his faith most
sorely was solved.  In confiding to him her story of
the mysterious influence which he had begun to
exercise over her, four years before she saw his face,
Isabel had declared that their lives were interfused in
an irresistible destiny.  She had spoken of this as a
fact more undeniable than the sun and moon.  She
evidently believed with her whole soul that God's
hand had brought them together.  Yet Antonio, all
through her pleading, had remained more persuaded
than ever that the selfsame God had called him to the
celibate life.  And the apparent impossibility of
reconciling these two equally clear, equally honest
convictions had kindled a fiery ordeal for the monk's faith.
The only way out of it seemed to be that all inward
illumination was a delusion&mdash;<i>totum corpus
tenebrosum</i>, "the whole body full of darkness"&mdash;and that
perhaps there was no Divine Enlightener at all.  But
this wonderful new thought which had come to him
at the old cura's grave explained everything.  He
thrust it into the most complicated wards of his
spiritual doubts, and it turned as smoothly as the
damascened key was wont to turn in the lock of the
chapel.  The doors of Isabel's soul rolled open before
his eyes, and a bright light shone into the furthest
cranny.
</p>

<p>
As for his duty to her in the present and in the
future, he understood it no less certainly than he
understood her chaste love for him in the past.  And, as
soon as this duty was plain, he made haste to begin
doing it; for it was a duty of prayer, of specific,
faithful, heroic, loving, unceasing prayer.  He prayed as
he walked, with increasing exultation.
</p>

<p>
So rapt was he by his holy work that Antonio hardly
noticed the difference between the dusty, lonely road
and the cobbled streets of noisy Navares.  He pressed
southward without a pause.  Was he not going home?
After a day and a night of banishment had not the
farm once more become the tranquil home of his body,
and had not the chapel once more become the rapturous
home of his soul?  He strode the last long league
of his homeward journey as if it had been the first;
and when he met José at the gate his face was shining
like an angel's.
</p>

<p>
True to his word, Antonio rose early the next morning
and threw himself body and soul into hard work.
Now that the abbey domain had come under his care,
there were hundreds of things to be done.  As the
sunny and well-drained slopes were exceptionally suitable
for the culture of a profitable amber-colored wine,
Antonio decided to double the area of the monk's old
vineyard immediately.  In order to effect this
extension and to repair the damage done by seven years'
neglect, it became necessary to engage nearly a score of
helpers, half a dozen of whom would have to be
retained in permanent employ.  José, with one resident
laborer, continued to live at the farm, while the monk
quietly resumed occupation of his own cell in the
monastery.
</p>

<p>
On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Antonio
dined at the farm with José; and on Tuesdays, Thursdays,
and Saturdays, José dined with his master beside
the stream in the monastery kitchen.  At these week-night
meals, the conversation was usually a review of
the day's operations and a debate as to the work of the
morrow; but on Sundays, when dinner was eaten
ceremoniously in the guest-house, such topics were not
mentioned, and the talk was of the great world's doings as
chronicled in Antonio's English paper, of Portugal's
troubles, and, above all, of churchly and holy things.
</p>

<p>
Not only during these Sunday talks, but also
throughout their work-a-day intercourse, José was
conscious of a change in Antonio.  Hitherto, the monk
had simply accepted the shaggy fellow's dumb
affection; but, after the day of his visit to the old
cura's grave, he began to show that he requited it as
well.  The last remains of his aloofness vanished, his
speech grew gentler, and he became more watchful of
José's health and comfort.  Nor was the monk's manner
changed towards José alone.  In all things and to
all persons he was more tender and less cold.
</p>

<p>
On the long winter evenings the two men busied
themselves with blue pigments and white glazes, until
they succeeded in fabricating tolerable copies of the
two broken azulejos.  When this was achieved, they
began a series of experiments, with a view to distilling
a new liqueur from eucalyptus.  By rashly gulping
down a mouthful of the first pint, José almost burned
out his tongue.  Nevertheless, they persevered; and, in
the long run, the monkish talent for cordial-making
enabled Antonio to mollify the harshness of the fiery
elixir, and to render it palatable.  In January they
shipped samples to agents in fever-cursed regions of
Spanish America, and offered to supply the liqueur in
bulk at a high price.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Antonio was waxing stronger in faith,
and hope, and love.  Every day he recited the whole
of his Office in his old stall, sometimes with José's
assistance, sometimes alone.  He began also to hear
Mass in the village church every Wednesday and
Friday, and to say the whole rosary every Sunday
afternoon.  In meditating on the fifteen Mysteries, he
habitually applied them to the case of Isabel; and,
somehow, these thinkings never became trite or stale.
In pursuance of his plan for Isabel's well-being, he
redoubled his prayers, and offered half his Mass-hearings
and communions with the same intention.
</p>

<p>
The winter passed and the spring came; and still he
had not heard a word from her or about her.
Sometimes a memory of her would suddenly overwhelm
him.  When he dined at the farm with José there
seemed to be always three persons, not two, at the
table.  He felt that she was sitting at his right hand,
where she had sat when he gave her the painted bowl;
and so strong was his sense of her presence that he
would often halt in the midst of a sentence, as if to
ask her pardon for the dryness of the talk.  After the
morrow of her flight, he never visited the
stepping-stones, although he repeatedly gave José minute
instructions for the conserving of the pool's beauties.
As for Isabel's chamber, he locked it up, and never
re-entered it.  Yet, in spite of this reverence for
everything she had touched, he never moped or repined.
He confided Isabel, as he had confided the fate of the
abbey, to the might and love of God.
</p>

<p>
When July came, he made a novena in honor of
Saint Isabel, the holy queen of Portugal, whose silver
shrine was the glory of the Poor Clare's great
convent opposite Coimbra, on the heights above the
Mondego.  And in August he received a long letter from
young Crowberry.  Seven of its eight pages were
concerned with England's theological and ecclesiastical
affairs: but in the midst of the page devoted to personal
matters, the young man had written:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>Of course, you know that Isabel has taken her father
to live at Weymouth.  I never see them; but I hear
they are both well, and that Sir Percy has become quite
reasonable and docile.  Have they told you how she
put her foot down and sent away that Excellent
Creature, Mrs. Baxter?  If she hadn't pulled up Sir Percy
I'm told he would have died.  Now, what did you
really and truly think of Isabel?  Did you see much of
her, or did she sulk?  Tell me when you write.</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Antonio wrote a long letter in reply; but he did not
tell young Crowberry what he really and truly thought
about Isabel, nor did he so much as mention her name.
His novena was answered.  It was enough for him to
know that Sir Percy lived, and that she was well.
</p>

<p>
The grape-harvest in September was a good one, and
it was only by cutting an hour from his sleep-time that
the monk could fill full his appointed measures of work
and prayer.  Then came October, with its vintage of
memories.  On the anniversary of Senhor Jorge's
serao Antonio could be serene; for Margarida had
just been happily married to a handsome and honorable
young man of Leiria, the son of a prosperous
builder.  But with the approach of the anniversary of
his first meeting with Isabel he grew troubled; and, to
divert his thoughts, he departed hurriedly for Lisbon,
where he had business to transact with the shippers of
his wines and cordials.  In Lisbon he learned that a
journey to England would be to his advantage.  But
England meant Isabel; so, on the anniversary of her
flight from the guest-house, he turned his back on the
capital and hastened home.
</p>

<p>
By mortgaging his farm the monk succeeded in
paying the third instalment of the abbey's price.  He
faced the New Year with less than twenty pounds of
ready money, and with the obligation to find five
hundred by the first of July.  A request for a more
flexible arrangement was flung back at him by the Fazenda
official with vindictive contempt.  As the spring
advanced, Antonio laid his plan for the immediate
outright purchase of the abbey on a fifteen hundred
pound mortgage before four separate persons; but
without exception they either could not or would not
entertain it.  In these circumstances he felt bound to
cut down his gifts to village charities and his bounties
to the hangers-on of the countryside.  As a result,
José came home one day with a black eye, received
while he was punishing three village loafers for calling
the Senhor da Rocha a skin-flint and a miser.
</p>

<p>
By May-day Antonio's sales of stock and the pledging
of his credit had brought him in only three hundred
pounds, and there was nothing left that he could
pawn without crippling himself hopelessly in the near
future.  But he was not cast down.  He was doing
his utmost, and he calmly left the rest with God.

<h3>
III
</h3>

<p>
Very early one morning, at the end of May, Antonio
heard light footsteps passing his cell.  Although he
sprang up immediately from bed he could not open
his door in time to see the intruder's face or form.
He caught no more than half a moment's glimpse of a
slender and darkly garbed figure disappearing round
the angle of the corridor.
</p>

<p>
Having scrambled into his clothes, he started in
pursuit.  The light tap-tap of shod feet on the stones
told him that his visitor was making for the chapel.
The monk, who was barefooted, followed noiselessly.
</p>

<p>
Peeping into the chapel through the little door amid
the azulejos, Antonio saw a tall spare man kneeling
before the altar.  Even if his back had not been turned
to Antonio it would have been impossible to see his
face, because he was hiding it in his hands.  The
stranger wore a long black cloak, uncomfortably thick
and heavy for the torrid Portuguese summer.  But it
was plain that he did not find it too warm.  With
long, thin, death-pale hands, he drew its folds more
closely round his body; and, as he did so, the familiar
movement revealed his identity to Antonio.
</p>

<p>
It was Father Sebastian.
</p>

<p>
Antonio hurried forward and knelt at his side.  But
Sebastian did not move, nor did he cease praying for
four or five minutes; and when at last he turned
towards Antonio it was without the slightest sign of
surprise.  Rising painfully, he left the altar and made
a gesture, inviting Antonio to follow him.
</p>

<p>
As Sebastian had stood next to Antonio in juniority
among the choir-monks, the stalls of the two men were
side by side.  Sebastian sat down in his old place and
Antonio did likewise.  The chapel was dim; but the
younger man could see that the elder's body had
wasted almost to a skeleton.  Yet there was nothing
repellent about him.  The bloom on his cheeks and the
fire in his eyes had the solemn beauty of a sunset in an
autumnal forest.  When he began to speak his voice
was so soft and sweet that it seemed to come from
some far-off holy height.
</p>

<p>
"To-day, Father Antonio," he said, "completes the
ninth year since you sat on the cloister roof and heard
the hoofs of the horsemen who had come to thrust us
from this house.  And, this morning, it is just nine
years since you were raised to the priesthood.  I asked
our Lord to give me strength for the journey, so that
I might spend this anniversary with you.  He has
heard me."
</p>

<p>
"Who told you that I was here?" Antonio asked.
</p>

<p>
Sebastian did not reply.  But there was that in his
eyes which gave Antonio a sufficient answer.  Here
was a saint who walked in the light.
</p>

<p>
"Nine years," mused Sebastian aloud.  "And you
have not yet said your first Mass."
</p>

<p>
"No," replied Antonio.  "But God is good.  Every
year He enables me to send a little cask of wine for
the altar to a poor church in England.  Six days a
week I work amid wine; and is not wine the matter of
His great Sacrament?  It consoles me to know that
although I cannot say Mass, I can serve His table.
Although I cannot, like Mary, his mother, bear Him in
my hands, I can be like those other Marys at the
sepulcher.  <i>Emerunt aromata ut venientes ungerent
Jesum</i>: 'They brought sweet spices that they might
anoint Jesus.'"
</p>

<p>
"He is not a God of the dead, but of the living,"
said Sebastian, in sweet, far-off tones.  "We do not
offer a dead Christ.  Say rather that you are like that
favored unknown to whom He sent two disciples
saying, <i>Ubi est diversorium ubi pascha cum discipulis
meis manducem</i>: 'Where is the guest-chamber where
I may eat the Passover with My disciples?'  But come.
Our time together is short, and there is much to say.
First of all, I have brought your breviary which you
charged me to keep."
</p>

<p>
He pointed to a package lying on the Prior's seat.
Antonio rose and took it with joyful gratitude.  When
he returned to his stall he said:
</p>

<p>
"Suffer my questions first.  Whence do you come?
Where have you lived these nine long years?"
</p>

<p>
"For a few months I was with the English fathers in
Lisbon," Sebastian answered.  "They were kind; but
when it became plain that the Portuguese Benedictine
congregation must come to an end, I crossed Spain and
sought asylum at the Montserrat, where men used to
believe the Holy Grail was treasured.  There was
much work for me to do there in the School of Music;
and I found strength to do it, for we lived like eagles
high up in the pure air, three thousand feet above the
sea.  But Madrid followed the example of Lisbon.
Greedy eyes were cast on our possessions.  They
accused us of being Carlists, just as in Portugal they
accused us of being Miguelistas: and only eighteen
months after leaving this abbey, I was again an exile.
Since then I have dwelt in three religious houses; and
every one of them has been suppressed."
</p>

<p>
"Can it be," asked Antonio uneasily, "that the
Orders are themselves to blame, as men say?  Here we
dwelt in simplicity and piety, living by our own labor
and feeding the poor.  But was this house an
exception?  Had the majority of other monks indeed sunk
into gluttony and sloth?"
</p>

<p>
"In every monastery from which I have been
driven," said Sebastian, "our evictors poured regrets
and compliments upon us.  It was always the misdeeds
of 'others,' for which we had to suffer.  But
whenever I questioned an exiled community, I found
they had received the same compliments.  Those
mysterious 'others' have still to be found.  According
to the statesmen, all religious houses individually
are fountains of light and blessing to their neighbors;
but collectively they are a dark curse on the
nations."
</p>

<p>
"Unbelieving men are determined to mulct us of all
we have," said Antonio, "and therefore they must
needs invent crimes to suit our punishment.  They
hang us first and indict us afterwards."
</p>

<p>
"They oppress us," agreed Sebastian, "in the great
and sacred name of liberty.  But the avarice of godless
men is the mainspring of it all.  I have seen five
houses confiscated 'for the good of the People'; and in
not one case have the People received a third of the
plunder.  But enough of this.  Tell me your own
story."
</p>

<p>
"Where is the Prior?"
</p>

<p>
"He is dead.  He died in Belgium."
</p>

<p>
"The Cellarer?"
</p>

<p>
"He is dead.  He died in Brazil."
</p>

<p>
"Father Isidoro?"
</p>

<p>
"He is dead.  He died in Spain."
</p>

<p>
With a sinking heart, Antonio named the choir-monks
one by one; and, after each name, Sebastian
answered: "He is dead."  Father Sebastian believed
that Brother Cypriano was still alive; but, of the
Fathers, only he and Antonio were left.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine</i>," murmured
Antonio.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Et lux perpetua luceat eis</i>," Sebastian responded.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow morning," added Sebastian, "will be
the anniversary of the Abbot's last Mass.  If our Lord
will give me strength I shall say Mass at this altar
once more."
</p>

<p>
After a pause, Antonio began to relate his history
from the moment of his quitting the council at
Navares.  Every fact that threw light on his operations
for regaining the abbey he stated with precision.  But
he did not mention Margarida, and he referred to
Isabel only as Sir Percy's moneyed daughter.  When
he had finished, Sebastian looked at him with
steadfast pitiful eyes and said:
</p>

<p>
"These have been great sacrifices and cruel hardships
for the sake of our Lord, and they will not be in
vain.  But you have not told me all.  My brother, I
feel that you have kept silence concerning your most
costly sacrifice, your bitterest ordeal.  Why not tell me
all?"
</p>

<p>
Antonio's pride rebelled.  The desire to ease his
heart by pouring out its hoard of solitary grief was
strong; but his gentleman's instincts of reticence were
stronger.  For some time he remained silent.  But an
inward voice sternly bade him speak; and he spoke.
</p>

<p>
He told the short tale of Margarida.  Then he unfolded
the whole case of Isabel, glossing over nothing.
He scrupulously added an account of his actions and
feelings on the night and morrow of her flight.  When
he had finished he sat with bowed head and waited for
Sebastian's judgment.  But Sebastian remained silent.
</p>

<p>
"You do not speak," said Antonio.  "Perhaps I
have given you the impression that my ordeal was
carnal, and that this English maiden was a direct
emissary of Satan.  If you think so, I have spoken
blunderingly indeed."
</p>

<p>
"Satan exists and he is busy enough," returned
Sebastian.  "But in trying to find the cause of any
strange thing that happens I have learned to think of
Satan last.  Nearly all our temptations arise from
our own self-love and carelessness.  Many other
temptations are God's provings and perfectings of our
spiritual mettle.  Satan is not omnipresent and his angels
are only a shrunken legion.  But have patience.  Let
me think."
</p>

<p>
He resumed his meditation.  At last he turned and
said:
</p>

<p>
"This was not a temptation from the devil.  Neither
did it spring from corruptness in your heart or in
hers.  I am persuaded that our Lord's work is somehow
in it all.  Perhaps you will never know in this
world what work it is; but that is not your affair."
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes," said Antonio slowly, "it troubles my
conscience.  As I told you just now, I didn't hold
out to the very end.  I gave way within my heart;
but when I opened my eyes she had vanished."
</p>

<p>
"You do wrong to be troubled," said Sebastian.
"You held out to the bitter end of the trial God had
appointed you.  When you told this Isabel finally to
go, she went.  That was the end.  All that happened
afterwards was mere reaction."
</p>

<p>
"The next day," persisted Antonio, "I did not say
my Office.  My heart bled for her as it never bled for
the Abbot, or for you, Sebastian, or for this place."
</p>

<p>
"It bled for her, not for yourself," Sebastian
explained.  "In profane love, the lover who thinks he
is grieving for the beloved is only grieving over
his own loss of her, over his own short bereavement,
or over his own humiliation and discomfiture.  With
you, Antonio, it was not so.  You did not wish to
take; you wished to give."
</p>

<p>
"Do not make me out a saint when I know I am a
sinner," said Antonio, almost sharply.  "If she had
been old, and tart, and ugly, would my heart have bled
for her all the same?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps not," Sebastian retorted.  "But, if she
had been old and ugly, neither would there have been
much virtue in giving her up.  Do not complain of her
beauty.  You had heroic work to do, and her beauty
helped you to do it better.  In England there are
Puritans who would say that these azulejos and these
gilded carvings must hinder us from doing the Work
of God."
</p>

<p>
"I do not follow you," said Antonio.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me," Sebastian asked abruptly, "how you
stand with the payments you have bound yourself to
make."
</p>

<p>
Antonio drew from his breast an account over which
he had pored and pored for a month without making
the adverse balance a vintem less.  Sebastian conned
it attentively from beginning to end.  Then he said:
</p>

<p>
"Follow me to my old cell and bring me paper and
ink."
</p>

<p>
He rose with so much difficulty that Antonio had to
support him; but once fairly on his feet he moved
quickly over the pavement.  At the door of the cell
Antonio left him; but before he had finished cutting
a new quill and replenishing the sand-sprinkler in his
own room, Sebastian rejoined him.  Sitting down
painfully at the tiny table he swiftly wrote a very short
letter.  Without reading it over he folded it, sealed it
with a small brass seal which he drew from his pocket,
and addressed it to a Spanish nobleman in a small
town of the Asturias.
</p>

<p>
"Let this be despatched at once," he said.  "There
is no time to lose."
</p>

<p>
"A post leaves Navares in three days," replied Antonio.
"José shall take the letter there this morning."
</p>

<p>
"It is well," said Sebastian.  "And when this José
returns, let me see him as soon as he is rested."
</p>

<p>
The cell was brighter than the chapel, and Antonio
perceived that his friend was become almost as
insubstantial as a ghost.  He called to mind a passage
from a new English poet about a man who, having
wasted to a shadow, was ready to be resumed into the
Great Shadow, the shadow and blackness of death.
But Sebastian seemed rather to be a pure white flame,
waiting to be drawn into the Great Light.
</p>

<p>
"You have not broken your fast," cried Antonio in
shame and alarm.  "You must eat.  I have good wine.
You must rest.  You must sleep.  When the heat is
over we will talk again, and you shall see José."
</p>

<p>
"It has been meat and drink and rest and sleep to
see you again, Father Antonio, and to hear what you
have told me," the other answered.  "But you are
right.  I must sleep.  I will obey your orders."
</p>

<p>
At breakfast Sebastian ate and drank nothing save
an ounce or two of bread and an egg beaten up in white
wine.  When the meal was over he declined Antonio's
pressing offer of a comfortable bed from the guest-house,
and lay down on the straw mattress in his own
cell.  There he soon fell into so profound a sleep that
he did not hear Antonio drenching the window with
bucketful after bucketful of water to counteract the
blazing heat.
</p>

<p>
At night José, wearing his best coat and his most
diffident manner, dined with the two monks in a corner
of the refectory.  Sebastian, with bright eyes and
glowing cheeks, did most of the talking.  He praised
the wine and the food, although he touched little of
either; and throughout the repast he was full of an
eager cheerfulness such as Antonio had never seen in
him before.  After dinner he drew from José an exact
account of his mental and spiritual state: for Antonio
had told him of the poor fellow's desire to become a
monk.
</p>

<p>
"José," he demanded, at the end of his questioning,
"You have learnt Latin.  Can you translate,
<i>Irascimini: et nolite peccare</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"I can, Father," answered José proudly.  "It means,
'Be angry and sin not.'"
</p>

<p>
"So it does.  You did well to be angry with the
greedy and lazy good-for-nothings who spake evil of
Father Antonio.  But you did ill to thrash them and
to come home with that black eye.  Go on being angry
with sin; but learn to love sinners."
</p>

<p>
"Can't I be a monk, Father?  May I not have the
habit?" pleaded José, in consternation.  "I am glad
I thrashed them; but I'm sure I shan't need to thrash
them again."
</p>

<p>
"The habit is a comfort and a help," Sebastian
replied, "but we must not give it you to-night.  Live as
you have been living, in the love of our Lord and in
obedience to Father Antonio.  For the present you
can wear no habit more acceptable to God than the
coat in which you do your daily duty about the farm.
Do not hang your head.  I foresee that an abbot will
once more rule within these walls, and that you, José
will die as one of his family.  Have patience."
</p>

<p>
A sudden change came over Sebastian as he ceased
speaking.  The hectic bloom faded from his cheeks,
and the heavy lids drooped over his preternaturally
bright eyes.  A moment later he sank forward
against the table.  Antonio and José sprang at once
to his help.  He had swooned.  They made haste to
bear him bodily to his cell.  It was an easy task; for
beyond the weight of his cloak there seemed to be
hardly anything to carry.  After they had laid him on
his bed and dashed water from the torrent in his face,
he revived and said faintly:
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, thanks, thanks, I am well.  Leave me.
I shall say mass to-morrow at five o'clock.  Leave
me."
</p>

<p>
He fell into another unnatural sleep.  But Antonio
did not leave him.  All through the short warm night
he watched and prayed.  At last the dull chant of the
Atlantic was drowned under the glittering trills of near
blackbirds.  Day dawned.  The sun rose above
Sebastian's Spain; and the sleeper awoke.
</p>

<p>
He answered the traditional <i>Benedicamus Domino</i>
with so ringing a <i>Deo gratias</i> that Antonio thought a
miracle had happened.  Sebastian looked stronger and
healthier than ever before.  Even José, who had been
sleeping heavily on the corridor floor, was aroused by
Sebastian's two words.
</p>

<p>
They repaired to the chapel.  There Father Sebastian
heard the confessions of his two companions.
Without delay he proceeded to the sacristy.  Antonio
followed him and began to lift from its drawer one of
the less costly vestments which had never been taken
away.  It was green and gold, as appointed in the
Ordo for that day.  But Sebastian, having bidden
him replace it, drew forth a black chasuble, simply
embroidered with a plain white cross.  Antonio felt
justly rebuked.  When the Abbot was dead, and the
Prior and all the fathers save two, surely it was meet
that the survivor's Mass should be a Mass of requiem.
</p>

<p>
From his pocket-case, Sebastian took the
unconsecrated wafers which he had brought from Lisbon.
He finished his vesting and preparation and they
re-entered the chapel.  José was kneeling devoutly on
the lowest step of the sanctuary.  Outside, hundreds
of birds were in full boisterous song.
</p>

<p>
Father Sebastian went to the foot of the altar and
began to say Mass.  He uttered the words quickly and
clearly, and made the genuflections without difficulty.
Indeed, Antonio, as he poured water over the white and
fleshless fingers at the psalm Lavabo, marveled more
than ever at the miracle of his friend's sudden strength.
At the commemoration of the dead, the intensity of
Sebastian's recollection seemed to make the whole
chapel thrill and throb, like a bed of reeds in a wind.
</p>

<p>
After he had given the most holy Body to Antonio
and to José, Sebastian concluded the Mass and returned
to the sacristy with a firm tread.  He laid aside
the sacred vestments and came back to his old stall in
order to make his thanksgiving.  Antonio, also in his
old stall, knelt at Sebastian's side.
</p>

<p>
The ascending sun cleared the top of the hill and
shone into the chapel.  The diadem of the Holy Child
blazed with glory.  In all the trees happy birds
redoubled their songs.
</p>

<p>
Half an hour passed.  José, arising noisily, made
Antonio open his eyes.  But Father Sebastian knelt
without moving against the sloping book-board.  José
clattered out.  Still Father Sebastian did not move.
Antonio waited, revering his friend's ecstasy of
communion with his Lord.  He waited long.  But
meanwhile a broad sunbeam had been working westward;
and at last it poured its burning gold upon the bended
head.
</p>

<p>
Antonio was stepping softly forward to screen his
friend from the fierce ray when a sudden instinct bade
him kneel down and look into Sebastian's face.  But
Sebastian's wide-open, rapturous eyes did not gaze into
Antonio's; nor were they beholding any earthly thing.
So beautiful was the sight that Antonio's exclamation
was more a shout of joy than a cry of fear.  Into his
mind there rushed the words of Isaias which had been
Sebastian's favorite scripture in the old days, <i>Regem
in decore suo videbunt oculi ejus</i>: "His eyes shall see
the King in His beauty; they shall behold the land
which is very far off."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Antonio and José buried the body of Sebastian that
night on the sunny side of the cloister, between the
third and fourth pillars, just under the tile-picture of
Enos, with its legend, <i>Ambulavit cum Deo et non
apparuit, quia tulit eum Deus</i>: "He walked with God
and was no more seen, for God took him."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0604"></a></p>

<h3>
IV
</h3>

<p>
On the feast of Saints Peter and Paul, just thirty days
after Sebastian's death, Antonio heard Mass in the
village church.  Forty-eight hours were left to him
before his payment to the Villa Branca Fazenda
became due.  In the strong-box at home he had only
three hundred and twelve pounds towards his debt of
five hundred.  Nothing had been received from
Sebastian's friend in Spain, although sufficient time had
elapsed for a reply to reach the farm.  Nevertheless,
Antonio rose from his knees at the end of Mass and
took his way homeward with a serene spirit.
</p>

<p>
From the point where he and José had seen the ruts
of young Crowberry's wheels nearly two years before,
the monk heard thumping hoofs.  He gazed down the
road and saw an advancing cloud of dust.  A few
moments later he made out the milk-white Branco
which had succeeded coal-black Negro as the Navares'
post-horse.  Thomé, the postman, drew rein and
handed Antonio two letters.
</p>

<p>
The first was from young Crowberry.  It ran:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>Dear Friend da Rocha.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>You will be sorry to hear that my father died last
week, suddenly.  I know you will pray for him; and
I hope you will pray for me too.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Strange to say, Sir Percy also passed away last week,
two days after my father.  I saw it in the papers, but I
know no details.  At Christmas my father saw him at
Weymouth, and he seemed well.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>As our affairs are tangled, I have much to do.
Write to me soon.  My thoughts turn to you very
often nowadays.  Tell me how you do, all round.  I
remain, your sincere friend.  Edward Crowberry.</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The second letter contained a draft for two hundred
pounds payable at sight in Navares.  Antonio regarded
it without emotion.  Even the fact that it was
unaccompanied by a single line of writing from the sender
did not stir him.  He had fully expected that the
money would arrive in due time from somewhere,
and it was no surprise to find it in his hand.  A single
thought filled every corner of his mind.  Isabel was
a thousand miles away, sunk in deepest sorrow, with
none to comfort her.
</p>

<p>
Thomé slapped Branco's neck noisily so as to arouse
Antonio from his reverie and to remind him that the
postage had not yet been paid.  Although it was not
the first time he had seen a man tear open a bulletin of
death at the roadside in the full blaze of noon, Thomé
was sympathetic.  But business was business.  In his
turn every man had to die; but meanwhile Thomé had
to live.  Antonio took the hint and gave the man his
money.
</p>

<p>
When José saw the draft, half an hour later, he so
far forgot a would-be monk's decorum as to execute a
rustic dance.  The next minute, without being
conscious of any incongruity, he said:
</p>

<p>
"Father I knew this money would come.  I knew it
this morning, at Mass.  What did the Introit say?
<i>Nunc scio vere quia misit Dominus angelum suum, et
eripuit me</i>: 'Now I know verily that the Lord hath
sent His angel and hath delivered me.'  I knew.  <i>Deo
gratias</i>."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Deo gratias</i>," echoed Antonio.  But his eyes were
dull and there was no ring of exultation in his tone.
He arose and went to his cell; but she seemed to be
there, opening the cupboards and searching sadly for
what she could not find.  He ascended to the roof of
the cloister: but restlessness dragged him down again.
Wandering out into the open-air his feet turned of
themselves towards the guest-house.  He meant to go
no further than the steps where she had said, "Promise
that I may see you again," and where he had carried
her like a child in his arms; but he soon opened the
door and made his way to the <i>salon</i>.  The sight of the
blue ottoman quickly drove him out again, and he
mounted the stairs until he stood outside her chamber.
The little key was in his pocket, for he never allowed
it to go out of his sight.  He fumbled for it and
touched it.  But it seemed to burn him.  He hurried
down the stairs and out of the house.
</p>

<p>
Striding along the broad path he returned to the
abbey and entered the chapel.  As he sat down in his
old place a sudden thought came to his help.  This was
the feast of Saints Peter and Paul, the twenty-ninth of
June; and on the eighth of July all Portugal would be
celebrating the feast of Saint Isabel, Portugal's holy
Queen.  There was just time, neither a day too much
nor a day too little, for the nine days of his novena.
He clutched at the coincidence like a drowning man at
a straw; and although in less perilous moments he
might have called it a straw, indeed, he found in it a
plank to buoy up his sinking soul.
</p>

<p>
There and then he began his nine day's pleading for
the Saint's intercession.  In deep humility he made use
of a little ill-printed pamphlet, bought by José years
before for a vintem at a village fair.  Outside this
penny chap-book one saw a rough woodcut of the
Holy Queen, with a crown on her brow and a scepter
in her hand.  Inside one found a sequence of pious
exercises for the novena, set forth in the simplest and
shortest words of the vernacular.  Antonio could
have extemporized more dignified prayers; but he
believed in the communion of saints and chose to
link himself with the child-like faith of the poor and
humble.
</p>

<p>
On the last of June he tramped into Navares to cash
the Spanish draft, and on the first of July he rode into
Villa Branca to pay away his money.  All the way out
and home, on both the days, he prayed.  Every morning
of the nine he heard Mass at the village, and on
three mornings he communicated as well.  He
besought José to pray for a special intention; and,
breaking through his reserve, he asked some of the village
Saints and Blessed Ones to do the same.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the work in vineyard and distillery had
grown heavy.  Throughout his novena he devoted six
hours of the twenty-four to sleep and meals, four to
Mass, Office, and prayers, and all the rest to
account-keeping and manual labor.  The resultant exhaustion
of his bodily strength seemed to sharpen his spiritual
senses.  On the fourth day, as he and José were saying
Lauds, Antonio could hardly resist the belief that
Sebastian's voice was joining in the holy Work.
When Lauds were finished and he was busy among the
vines, he decided that his overstrained nerves had been
wrought upon by his knowledge that Sebastian's grave
was only a few yards away, just outside the cloister
doorway.  The next morning, however, his inward
ear seemed to hear afar off a vast babble of deep voices,
as if all the generations of Saint Benedict's sons
throughout thirteen hundred years were reciting Lauds
together.
</p>

<p>
On the sixth and seventh and eighth mornings this
mighty murmur of deep voices reverberated persistently
in his ears, like the echoes of distant Niagaras
and Atlantics.  On the ninth morning, after his Mass
and communion, he heard it again; but this time there
was a difference.  While he was beseeching the Isabel
in heaven to pray for the Isabel on earth, an ineffable
harmony filled the ears of his soul.  Blending with the
deep voices he heard voices that were high and sweet
and clear, like woodbine and sweet honeysuckle and
roses intertwining among the sturdy trunks and
branches of an ancient forest.  It was as if all the
generations of Saint Benedict's daughters had added
their songs to the songs of all Saint Benedict's sons.
</p>

<p>
The tide of harmony ebbed slowly away.  But it
left behind it a strange peace in Antonio's soul; even
as the tides of ocean bathe the burning sands and leave
them clean and cool.  The peace which filled him
passed his understanding, and he did not try to
explain it.  Rising up quietly, he gave the little book
back to José and went about his work.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
October came again; but this time Antonio did not
run away.  Until the Indian summer ended he was
quieter than usual; but he met its memories without
bitterness.  The door of Isabel's room was still kept
locked; he still avoided the stepping-stones, and every
night and morning he remembered her in his prayers;
but she had receded from the foreground of his life.
</p>

<p>
November and December were crowded with money
troubles.  The sales of the farm and sea-sand wines
increased every year, and there was a constant demand
for the two liqueurs: but Antonio's customers soon
perceived that he was not a hard man, and they imposed
upon him by taking excessive credit.  His business
needed capital; but every development had to be paid
for out of revenue.  Worst of all, a further
instalment of five hundred pounds fell due on New Year's
Day.
</p>

<p>
There was young Crowberry; but, after what he
had said about his father's confused affairs, the monk
did not think it fair to ask him for a loan.  There was
also Sebastian's Asturian nobleman; but loyalty to his
dead friend restrained Antonio from requesting the
Spaniard's further help.  In his difficulty he wrote to
Senhor Castro and followed up the letter by presenting
himself in person at the old Castro cellars in Oporto
early in December.
</p>

<p>
Senhor Castro, who had grown old and liverish, did
not want to be troubled.  He admitted that Antonio's
English journey had firmly established the Castro
fortunes; but, although he was a rich man, he gave
proofs that all his money was invested beyond
immediate recall.  In the long run, Antonio crossed the
bridge of boats from Gaia empty-handed.
</p>

<p>
He searched for the cobbler, his old landlord; but
the whole family had gone to Brazil.  Twice or thrice
during his heart-wearing stay in the city he was
cheered by the best of greetings in the worst of
Portuguese from Gallegos to whom he had been kind nine
years before.  These Gallegos, however, did not help
him to raise five hundred pounds.  They were the
Gallegos who had failed; for the Gallegos who had
succeeded were all returned into Galicia with their
savings.
</p>

<p>
A few days before Christmas the monk clinched a
bad bargain with a small firm of so-called Anglo-Portuguese
bankers, who were really common money-lenders
in bankers' clothing.  The head of the firm hailed
from Hamburg and his partner was a Portuguese Jew.
These plausible rascals agreed to lend Antonio a
thousand pounds on unconscionable terms.  Although the
nominal interest was only seven per cent., one extra
and another made it over twenty.  For sending a clerk
to attend the transfer at Villa Branca they required
forty pounds, although his expenses could not exceed
twelve.  The conditions as to repayment were harsh.
As security, the usurers required a first mortgage on
the abbey, a second mortgage on the farm, a note of
hand from Antonio, and a hold on the receipts from
wine.  The monk's heart sank as he signed the fatal
parchment; but he espied the gleam in the Hamburg
man's eye too late.
</p>

<p>
On New Year's Day, Antonio had a moment of
brightness when the abbey passed finally out of the
control of the Fazenda official; but he soon found that
he had exchanged a whip for a scorpion.  Before the
moneylender's clerk returned to Oporto he confided
vexatious instructions to the most unprincipled of the
Villa Branca attorneys, who rarely allowed a month to
pass thereafter without sending for Antonio on some
frivolous pretext.  Whenever this objectionable
person and his still more objectionable wife desired a
Sunday jaunt they drove over to the farm or the abbey,
sponging on Antonio's hospitality and poking
inquisitorial noses into everything.  One day the pair
brought two char-à-bancs full of their kindred to
celebrate the senhora's birthday by a picnic at the
stepping-stones; and when Antonio very courteously
begged that the good things might be drunk and eaten
in some other part of the domain, the attorney
promptly became his active enemy.
</p>

<p>
Years passed.  In spite of a hundred obstacles the
wines and liqueurs made steady progress, and Antonio
seemed to be within reach of his goal.  Having ground
out to the usurers nearly two thousand pounds in legal
costs, interest, and repayment of principal, he owed
them less than two hundred.  A debt on his farm still
remained; but the Navares' mortgagee was a reasonable
man who was willing to wait.  The monk reckoned
that one more prosperous year would release him
from the moneylenders' clutches and that, two years
later, both the farm and the abbey would be his.
</p>

<p>
But Portugal's honest, hardworking men and
women were once more being brought to the brink of
ruin by the politicians.  The minister, Costa Cabral,
having been created Count of Thomar, sought to
repay Queen Maria da Gloria by measures of excessive
royalism; and immediately all the turbulent spirits in
the country were let loose.  Some rough-and-ready
poet dashed down a Portuguese Marseillaise, in which
an imaginary "Mary of the Fountain" was hymned as
a Joan of Arc raised up to save the fatherland.  In
Villa Branca and Navares, Antonio often heard the
lads singing:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Maria of the Fountain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has a sword in her hand,<br>
  To slay the false Cabrals,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traitors to their land.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Forward! brothers, forward!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward! be our cry;<br>
  On! for holy Freedom<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conquer or to die.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Suddenly the Septembrists took arms.  Under the
Viscount Sa da Bandeira there broke out the insurrection
called by some the Mob-war and by others the war
of Maria da Fonte.  Cabral fell, and the Marshal
Saldanha filled his place.  To end the bloodshed and
disorder foreign Powers intervened.
</p>

<p>
On the feast of Saints Peter and Paul, exactly four
years after Antonio began his memorable novena to
Saint Isabel, the Convention of Granada was signed
and a general amnesty was declared.  The good news
reached the farm on Saint Isabel's day, and Antonio
hoped against hope that the dates were good omens.
But within two years Cabral was once more in power;
and, two years later, Saldanha and his soldiers once
more turned him out.
</p>

<p>
One morning Thomé and Branco, both grown old,
brought a letter to announce the bankruptcy of the
Lisbon shippers to whom Antonio had entrusted the
collection of his accounts.  The news came barely a
week before a further payment of one hundred
pounds fell due to the moneylenders.  Antonio
immediately hired a fast horse and hastened to Oporto.
In answer to his request, the Jew and the German
blandly offered to renew his bonds on terms so
outrageous that the monk walked out of their office.  But
only three days remained, of which one was a holiday.
He called at Senhor Castro's house to find the master
dead.
</p>

<p>
On the face of it, to raise a sum of two hundred
pounds on property worth three thousand was an
absurdly easy task, and Antonio counted on being able
to wash his hands of the moneylenders within twenty-four
hours.  But owing to the political unrest an
acute financial crisis prevailed in Oporto.  Money was
scarce and lenders were shy.  Antonio's security was
scores of leagues away, and there was no time to
inspect it; nor could the title be easily investigated, as the
deeds were in the money-lenders' hands.
</p>

<p>
On his last day of grace the monk presented himself
again at the so-called bank and stated that he
would accept the hard terms offered.  He was received
with a volley of abuse.
</p>

<p>
"What?" roared Senhor Neumann.  "You have
the impudence to come here again?  After all our
kindness the other day, what did we get?  Nothing
but ingratitude and insults.  Get out.  We're sick of
the whole business.  I'm determined to be done with
it once for all.  If you've brought our money, pay it
and don't argue.  If not, we foreclose the mortgage,
and I shall write to Villa Branca to-night."
</p>

<p>
"You are quite right, Neumann," said Senhor Mual.
"We were talked to like dirt.  Senhor da Rocha
could not have turned his back on us more offensively
if we had been downright extortioners or common
money-lenders.  But don't be too hard on a man in a
hole."
</p>

<p>
"I shall write to Villa Branca to-night," persisted the
German.  "I like business to be pleasant.  What did
the Senhor come here for at all, if he didn't mean to
be straightforward?  I like business to end as
pleasantly as it begins.  I like dealing with gentlemen."
</p>

<p>
Antonio bit his tongue.  Senhor Mual spoke again;
and once more Senhor Neumann retorted.  At last
their trite play-acting came to its usual end with the
German loudly exclaiming:
</p>

<p>
"Very well, very well, have your way.  We're a
brace of soft-hearted old fools.  Every scamp that
comes along can get round us; it'll serve us right if we
both die in the Misericordia."
</p>

<p>
Antonio signed fresh papers and hurried back to
José.  He spent three days writing English and
Spanish and Portuguese letters to his customers in the
Americas, unfolding new offers of discounts and a
proposal for cash-payments against bills of lading.
The result was the loss of half his Latin patrons,
whose business could only be conducted on credit.
Concurrently with these disasters the Lisbon Government
kept on demanding larger and larger taxes; and
Antonio never caught sight of the old white horse
Branco without a shrinking of heart.
</p>

<p>
The monk fought on.  To save a pound or two a
year he gave up his English papers.  But crisis
followed crisis, and before long he owed Neumann and
Mual almost as much as he had borrowed from them
in the first instance.  The two scoundrels played with
him like anglers playing a pike.  Sometimes they
gave him so much line that he seemed to be regaining
the deep broad flood of freedom.  For a year at a
time their letters would be friendly and the Villa
Branca persecution would cease; but whenever the
debt fell below three hundred pounds they struck
sharply and began winding the firmly hooked fish
pitilessly back to the bank.  They knew how to enmesh
him in widespread nets of petty litigation; and,
although Antonio was far cleverer than the attorney,
his cleverness availed him nothing.  The affidavits of
his opponents were invariably perjurious, but the monk
scorned to swear falsely in reply, even on the most
trifling point.  Had he possessed money to carry
appeals into the higher courts he might have obtained
justice; but he never succeeded in going further than
the Villa Branca court of first instance, where local
corruption smiled at the maxim that Truth is mighty
and must prevail.
</p>

<p>
Throughout these trials Antonio constantly advanced
in the love of God and his neighbor.  Although
he could not give money, he gave his time and strength
and knowledge to the help of the weak and harassed
around him.  A new cura came to the village, who
soon discerned the spirituality of his mysterious
parishioner and insisted on his enjoying the great
consolation of serving at Mass.  Meanwhile the monk kept
up the daily recitation of the Divine Office in his old
stall.  Very often he was cheered by hearing again
with his inward ear the vast, sweet chant of all Saint
Benedict's sons and daughters.  In spite of his
troubles he was nearly always cheerful; and he would
often echo the words of Saint Paul and say, <i>In
omnibus tribulationem patimus</i>: "We suffer trouble on
every side, but we are not in anguish, we are
perplexed, but not in despair, we suffer persecution, but
we are not forsaken, we are cast down, but we are not
destroyed."
</p>

<p>
One morning, when he was dressing for an iniquitous
law-suit, Antonio noticed that his hair at the
temples had begun to turn gray.  The next moment he
remembered that it was the eve of his birthday, and
that on the morrow he would be fifty years old.
</p>

<h3>
V
</h3>

<p>
Late one December night, as he lay in his lonely cell,
a furious gale aroused Antonio from sleep.  Something
was groaning and creaking outside.  He sat bolt
upright and listened until he became certain that the
great iron cross which formed the finial to the chapel
roof had worked loose.
</p>

<p>
The monk sprang up and ran out into the rain.
Scaling the chapel wall by means of a swaying ladder,
he found to his dismay that the cross was within an
ace of falling.  There was no time to run down to the
farm for help, nor even to return to the abbey for
tools.  The only action that could avail was to stand
with his whole weight on the last ridge-stone and to
hold up the cross against the wind with his whole
strength.
</p>

<p>
Antonio took the cross in his arms.  The sou'-wester,
roaring like a thousand lions, thrashed him
with stinging thongs of cold rain and did its best to
hurl him down, cross and all.  But he held on.  Time
after time the ridge shook like a bog under his feet,
and the great finial tugged at his arms like a captured
beast striving to escape.  His hands bled through
gripping the sharp edges of the iron.  Once or twice,
during the first half-hour, he was on the point of relaxing
his grasp; but a great thought put endurance into his
heart and strength into his arms.  He thought of his
Lord, cleaving to the cross on Calvary with an
intensity of love which fastened Him there more
securely than the iron nails.  He thought of the
darkness which was over all the land from the sixth to the
ninth hour.  Hitherto the monk had thought of that
darkness as a mere absence of light; but, as he clung
to the iron, with the brutal tempest howling and
roaring and screaming, with the roofs and the trees
whining and moaning, and with the icy darts of rain
wounding him like thorns, he understood that it was a
darkness reeling with all the sin of the world and
envenomed with the hot panting of all hell's devils.
With blood on both his hands and pains like red-hot
needles in both his feet Antonio thanked God for this
livelier sense of his Savior's passion, and he repeated
the words of Saint Paul, <i>Mortificationem Jesu in
corpore nostro circumferentes</i>: "Bearing about in our
bodies the dying of Jesus."
</p>

<p>
Towards dawn, when the world seemed to be rocking
under him and he was ready to faint, Antonio recalled
that other night of storm when, in the chapel
below, Isabel had nestled in his arms.  Her presence
seemed to be with him once more.  It was as though
her white slender hands were helping his to uphold the
thick black iron, and as though her soft, sweet tones
were murmuring encouragement in his ear.  The gale
and the rain bellowed and spat, but Isabel's voice softly
drowned their din.  <i>Erat cum bestiis, et angelus
ministrabat illi</i>: "He was among wild beasts, and an angel
ministered unto him."
</p>

<p>
José, hurrying to the abbey before sunrise to report
serious damage among the sea-sand vines, arrived just
in time to save both the cross and his master.
Having driven in a wedge, he made haste to help Antonio
down and to coax him into bed.  To bed the monk
went; and in bed he remained for a week, consumed
by fever and tortured by nightmares.  He seemed to
be holding the lockless, boltless door of the chapel
against the two usurers and the chief of the Fazenda
and the Villa Branca attorney.  He, Antonio, was
holding it shut by fiercely pressing knees and thighs
and arms and hands, and shoulders and brow against
the oak while his enemies charged at it like roaring
waves at a cliff.
</p>

<p>
When the monk arose from bed his magnificent
health was gone.  He suffered from headaches, and
could no longer walk to the neighboring towns or do
much manual labor.  To employ his enforced leisure
he advertised himself in two or three English and
French papers as a private tutor wishing to receive one
or two boarder-pupils for instruction in the classics,
modern languages, and commercial routine; but there
was no response.
</p>

<p>
Happily this illness befell during one of Antonio's
periods of relief from the usurers' persecution.  He
knew, however, that such calms always heralded
storms; and therefore he determined to use what
health and strength remained to him in a grand effort
to break out of the usurers' power.  His debt, or
rather their claim, stood at about nine hundred pounds.
By selling the mortgaged farm and sea-sand vineyards,
and also the whole plant, stock, and good-will of the
wine and liqueur business as a going concern, Antonio
could pay off the nine hundred and turn his back on
Neumann and Mual forever.  In the event of local
lenders clamoring for the liquidation of the floating
debts which he had incurred on the strength of his
personal credit, he would be able to satisfy them by
mortgaging the abbey timber and part of the domain
with a Navares mortgagee.  Then, although his health
was enfeebled and José was no longer young, he
would set himself to the task of clearing off the last
debts by branding his amber-colored wine and pushing
it in England.
</p>

<p>
Although so many miracles had been vouchsafed to
him, both in his spiritual and in his temporal affairs,
Antonio continued to employ all his energy and
prudence.  He maintained his old policy of doing the
best he could and leaving the rest to God; but, until he
had done his utmost, he would have felt it irreverent
to expect a miracle.  He would plan his campaign and
dispose his forces and post his safeguards as if
everything depended on his own arm and his own brain;
and then, but only then, he would fall down in deepest
humility and demand the divine help as if everything
depended upon God.  Accordingly he went about his
new operations with so much circumspection that it
was high summer before he saw his way to act
decisively.
</p>

<p>
A payment of two hundred pounds to the usurers
was almost due.  It was payable through the Villa
Branca attorney.  Antonio had over a hundred in
notes at the abbey, and he reckoned that the foreign
drafts in the hands of his banker at Navares would
yield at least a hundred and twenty more.  As
traveling fatigued him he made up his mind to combine
the Navares and Villa Branca journeys in one.  At
Navares he would cash his drafts and open his negotiations
for the sale of the farm and the wine-business;
and thence he would ride over the hills to Villa Branca
and pay away his two hundred.
</p>

<p>
There was no hitch at the Navares bank.  The
drafts realized one hundred and thirty-one pounds.
With a thankful heart Antonio placed the paper money
in his pocket-book and stowed it safely away in his
belt of English leather.  But before he was ready to
go two men pushed the door open and strode hastily
to the counter.
</p>

<p>
"It has come?" demanded the elder.
</p>

<p>
"No.  Nothing," said the banker.  "But I expect
another post to-night."
</p>

<p>
The younger man staggered back as if he had been
struck.  As soon as he turned Antonio knew him.  He
was Margarida's brother, Luis.  Senhor Jorge had
been dead two years, and Luis was the head of the
house.  The elder man Antonio recognized as Margarida's
husband, the builder's son from Leiria, who had
set up business on his own account in Navares.  Not
wishing to intrude into their trouble, the monk tried to
slip out unobserved.  But Luis saw his face and
hurried towards him with a cry of joy.
</p>

<p>
"It is the Senhor da Rocha," he cried.  "Theophilo,
you are saved."
</p>

<p>
"We shall see," said Theophilo quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Let us go to the Campo," suggested Antonio.
"There we can talk quietly."
</p>

<p>
They walked along the shady side of the street until
they came to the deserted public garden.  Under an
old lime-tree they sat down, beside a plashing
fountain, and the monk waited for the others to speak.
</p>

<p>
"It is a matter of money," stinted Theophilo, "and
it is not with my consent that Luis troubles your
Worship about it."
</p>

<p>
"Before my father died," Luis began, "he called
me to him and said: 'Luis, you and your brothers and
sister have health and a little wealth, but I can't
expect that you won't have troubles.  When troubles
come, be men and fight them as I have fought mine.
But, if ever they are too strong for you, go to Manoel
da Rocha up at the old abbey.  We have seen little of
him, through a misunderstanding that was no fault of
his; but I know his worth.  Tell him your trouble
and he will help you out.'  Those were my father's
very words; and that's why I stopped your Worship
at the bank."
</p>

<p>
"Your father was one of the best men I ever met,"
said Antonio.  "May he rest in peace.  Tell me your
trial; and if I can help you I will."
</p>

<p>
"It is not easy to tell," faltered Luis.  "If we
cannot raise a conto of reis by three o'clock Theophilo
must go to prison.  My mother and Margarida will
die of disgrace."
</p>

<p>
"Luis has not told your Worship," broke in
Theophilo proudly, "that if I go to prison I go for
another's crime.  Before God, I am innocent.  In an
accursed hour I became the friend of Victor Sequeira,
the treasurer to the municipal council.  When I began
business he lent me a few milreis.  Last year he
persuaded me to endorse some bills.  He swore it was a
matter of form.  The bills have been protested, and I
am responsible.  On Monday I found that Sequeira
ran away last week and that the bills were fraudulent,
and that I cannot clear myself of complicity in the
swindle.  For my wife's sake they gave me four days
to find the money.  The time expires at three o'clock.
We have pledged everything; but we still need a conto
of reis.  That is the tale.  Luis has made me tell it.
We have no right to expect that your Worship is
interested in such a miserable affair."
</p>

<p>
"I am interested, I am grieved most deeply," said
Antonio, in great agitation.  "I know what it is to
suffer terribly through signing papers in a hurry.  But
... a conto of reis!  Two hundred and twenty
English pounds!"
</p>

<p>
"It is a great sum," answered Luis simply.  "But
if your Worship had it, he would lend us the money.
It is only for a few hours.  The bank expects a post
to-night.  Theophilo has written to his father, and the
money will come."
</p>

<p>
"Senhor Theophilo," said Antonio, who had become
very pale, "at this moment I have two hundred and
thirty-eight pounds in my belt.  I meant to sleep here
to-night, at the hospedaria, and to go on Saturday to
pay the money away at Villa Branca.  To settle my
debt there is more than life or death to me."
</p>

<p>
Theophilo curled his lip.
</p>

<p>
"Your Worship is scornful," added Antonio.  "If
your Worship were not too well-bred he would say
that I am telling a tale such as men nearly always tell
when they are asked for a loan of money.  No doubt
Luis here partly thinks the same.  Everybody in the
village knows that I make a great deal of money and
that I spend no more than a peasant.  Everybody
knows that I'm called the abbey miser and that I
give away hardly a pound a year."
</p>

<p>
They remained silent.
</p>

<p>
"But everybody doesn't know," the monk continued,
"that for more than fifteen years I have been in the
grip of Oporto money-lenders.  Everybody doesn't
know that I have paid thousands of pounds&mdash;yes,
thousands&mdash;in costs and interest, and that I still owe nearly
as much as the original loan.  I was going to Villa
Branca to pay them nearly a conto of reis, and I had
set my whole heart on getting out of their power.  If
I must renew this part of the debt it will be on ruinous
terms, and I have no longer the health to go on fighting."
</p>

<p>
"I have stated already," declared the proud Theophilo,
"that Luis has troubled your Worship without
my consent.  If I must go to prison ... well, to
prison I must go, as better men have gone before me."
</p>

<p>
"Not so fast," said the monk.  "Humanly speaking,
is it certain your father will send the funds?  Have
you recent knowledge of his financial position?  Can
he disengage money from his business at such short
notice?  If I let you have the use of my conto of reis
till to-morrow night, is there a risk of my losing it?"
</p>

<p>
"None!" cried Luis.  But Theophilo, having
reflected, said:
</p>

<p>
"I thank the Senhor.  I shall not trouble him.
There is a risk.  An Englishman, from one of their
great cities called Scotland, is contractor for works at
Figueira da Foz.  He has farmed out his contract to
my father, and he is treating him unfairly.  Your
Worship, there is a risk."
</p>

<p>
Antonio sat staring at the fountain.  In spite of the
great heat he felt cold.  At three o'clock Senhor
Jorge's son-in-law and Margarida's husband must be
thrown into a felon's prison for a crime not his own,
in default of one conto of reis.  And he, Antonio,
had a conto of reis in his belt.  By lending this proud
and honest man the money he could perform a work
of mercy which would pluck six men and women out
of an inferno of despair and raise them to a paradise
of thankfulness.
</p>

<p>
But there was a risk, a grave risk.  Judging by his
experience of Portuguese mercantile concerns, Antonio
could indulge only a faint hope of Theophilo's receiving
the money from Leiria before it was due at Villa
Branca.  And in that event&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The Navares clock struck two.  Theophilo sprang
to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Adeus, Senhor," he said, "and thanks."
</p>

<p>
"No!" cried Antonio, plunging after him and
gripping his arm.  "I have not refused.  An hour
remains.  Give me thirty minutes.  This is a terrible
affair.  Stay here.  In half an hour I will return."
</p>

<p>
Without awaiting an answer he hurried away.
Quitting the Alameda by a side gate, he dived into a
sunless alley and pushed at the door of the church of
the Santa Cruz.  It swung inwards.  He hastened
along the broad nave until he came to the brazen grille
which barred the chapel of the Santissimo.  There he
sank down on the plank floor and, stretching despairing
hands to the Presence on the altar, he cried out in
agony, <i>Domine, quid me vis facere</i>: "Lord, what wilt
Thou have me to do?"
</p>

<p>
The answer came swiftly.  It was as though a
voice, a strong Man's voice, yet a voice even sweeter
than Isabel's, said in his ear:
</p>

<p>
"Antonio, lend Theophilo your conto of reis."
</p>

<p>
Of all the supernal voices which had ever spoken to
him, this was the nearest and the clearest.  If the
brazen grille had opened and an angel had come forth
proclaiming it with the voice of a trumpet, Antonio
could not have been more sure that his Lord was
bidding him lend Theophilo the money.  Yet he could
not, all in a moment, accept the answer.  Horror,
kindling almost to anger, filled his soul.
</p>

<p>
So this was to be the end.  For fifteen years he had
been slaving to fill the pockets of infamous extortioners;
and now he was to take the price of freedom and
pay it away to replace the plunderings of a runaway
swindler.  A hideous thought, more foul and hideous
than the blankest atheism, rushed into his mind.  It
was a thought about God.  That God existed Antonio
could not doubt; nor could he question that God
intervened, as the Christians believe, in men's and
women's lives.  The Christians said that He was
all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-loving.  But perhaps the
truth was, after all, that He was all-powerful,
all-knowing, and all-mocking.
</p>

<p>
Antonio could grant that a work of mercy to men
should take precedence of a work of praise towards
God.  But if God had intended him for works of
mercy, why had He called him into a contemplative
Order, and why had He suffered him to go on finding
a dozen contos for usurers while he was refusing
pence to honest men?  And Isabel, his breaking of the
heart of Isabel&mdash;how did that supreme deed fit into
the sorry scheme?  Yes, God had mocked him.  He
had made the world, and all the men and women in it,
as a puppet-show to divert His eternal boredom.  He
had sat lounging on the arch of heaven for five-and-twenty
years watching his, Antonio's, toil and strife
just as a lazy lout lolls on the grass watching ants
working hour after hour at the ant-hill which he
intends to kick to pieces before he goes home.
</p>

<p>
The monk did not deliberately think these thoughts.
They swept thunderously over him like a tidal wave
drowning a lowland coast.  For a moment they roared
in his ears and took away his wits.  But as he came to
the surface he rallied all the forces of his soul and
struck out desperately to regain his rock of faith.
God was no mocker.  He was Love, all Love; and the
thick blackness of this new and dreadful ordeal was
only a shadow cast by the eternal Light.  Nevertheless,
Antonio all but failed to resist the sucking undertow
of fresh doubts and to maintain his foothold amidst
the battering surf of despair.
</p>

<p>
Close beside him, on an altar to the right of the
grille, rose a statue of the Blessed Virgin, crowned
with a golden crown and robed in the blue velvet robe
of an eighteenth-century Portuguese princess.  To her
Antonio cried out for help.  When words of his own
refused to come he poured forth the words of Saint
Bernard's prayer <i>Memorare</i>.  For a prolonged while
no help came, and he crouched on the planks, shrinking
from the heavy stripes which God had appointed
him.  He remembered the ruined abbeys of England.
Doubtless stronger and wiser men than he had labored
to restore them to the Church and to her Orders; but
three hundred years had passed, and so far as Antonio
knew, not one monastic house had been rebuilt upon
the old foundations.  Perhaps it was the divine will
that the Orders, renouncing the world, should never be
too long rooted in this acre or that; and perhaps it was
ordained that they must renew their vows to the Lady
Poverty in hovels and barns and caves.  But, in that
case, why had God bidden him waste his life in
separation from the exiled brethren of his Order?  He
gazed through the grille as if he would demand the
answer.  But the ears of his soul heard no word save:
</p>

<p>
"Antonio, lend Theophilo your conto of reis.
Antonio, lend Theophilo your conto of reis."
</p>

<p>
Not yet could he submit.  The smoldering rebellion
in his heart was quickening for a burst of flame.  At
last his eyes rested on the faded gilt legend running
along the pedestal of the Virgin's blue-robed image,
<i>Ecce ancilla Domini, fiat mihi secundum verbum tuum</i>:
"Behold the handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me
according to thy word."  To Antonio this brief
scripture recalled more than the pearly moment when the
Virgin of virgins, despising the evil tongues of men
and looking steadfastly into the deep, dark eyes of
sorrow, surrendered herself to the will of God; for it
recalled also the fiery hour when he himself, in the
same words, had finally accepted the monastic life.
With the memory of old battles and old victories there
rushed upon him new graces.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ecce servus Domini</i>," he cried in sudden triumph,
"<i>fiat mihi secundum verbum tuum!</i>"  And, having
prostrated himself with loving reverence before his
Master, he rose up and sped back to the Campo, where
Theophilo was striding up and down.
</p>

<p>
"Senhor Theophilo," said the monk, "I will lend you
my conto of reis."
</p>

<p>
Theophilo stared at him in amazement.  So sure had
he felt of Antonio's refusal that he would not have
remained in the Campo had there been any other quiet
and open place wherein to spend his last hour of
freedom.  He resisted; flushed; seized the monk's hand
and dropped it the same moment; and at last began
to stammer incoherent protests and thanks.
</p>

<p>
"But I will lend it," continued Antonio, "only on
one condition."
</p>

<p>
"On any condition you like," cried Theophilo, beside
himself with joy.  "If it's a hundred per cent, I
don't mind.  I'll work like a slave to pay back every
vintem and still I shall be your Excellency's debtor."
</p>

<p>
"I ask harder terms than a hundred per cent,"
explained the monk quietly.  "My condition is this.
Pledge me your word that if your father's money does
not come in time to settle my own debt in Villa Branca
you will never reproach yourself on my account.
Promise that you will believe me when I say that,
although I shall be happier to-morrow night with your
father's conto of reis, I shall not be miserable without
it.  Promise to believe that, if your father fails us,
I shall have no grievance against him or against Luis
or against you."
</p>

<p>
Theophilo could only stand stock still, staring and
breathing hard.  The clock struck half-past two.
</p>

<p>
"Quick!" urged Antonio.  "There's no time to lose.
See, here is the conto of reis.  Pledge me your word
that you will obey my condition, and the money is
yours."
</p>

<p>
"Your Worship cannot mean this," broke in Luis.
He had leaned against Antonio expecting to find him a
broken reed, and he could hardly believe that this
oak-like sturdiness was not a delusion.
</p>

<p>
"I mean every word," Antonio answered.  "Come,
take the money.  I trust you to remember the terms."
</p>

<p>
He drew a few notes from the pocket-book and
pressed all the rest into Theophilo's hand.  The young
builder clutched them eagerly; but a moment later he
sought to thrust them back.
</p>

<p>
"No," he groaned, "I cannot, I must not.  My
father will fail me and you will curse us!"
</p>

<p>
"Come," answered Antonio gently, "I will tell you
a secret.  I have a Friend.  While you sat by this
fountain I went and asked His advice.  I have asked it
many and many a time, and He has never misled me
yet.  He told me to lend you this conto of reis.  If the
post does not bring a conto in its place, do not grieve.
It is between my Friend and me.  Go."
</p>

<p>
They looked at him wonderingly; but he hastened
away.  From the far side of the garden he saw them
stand a whole minute irresolute.  Then Luis seized
Theophilo's arm and they walked off quickly into the
town.  As for Antonio, he returned to the church of
Santa Cruz, and there, in a corner, he began to say his
Office.  He recited it without rapture, but with a
quietness of mind which was better than ecstasy.
</p>

<p>
Towards four o'clock two men entered the nave and
knelt before the brazen grille.  They did not discover
Antonio; but, from his obscure corner, he could see
their faces as they rose from their knees, and he knew
that they had guessed Who was his Friend.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
VI
</h3>

<p>
The post arrived at six o'clock; but it brought no
letter from Theophilo's father.  Luis, with a pale face
came to the hospedaria after dinner and broke the news
falteringly.  Glancing through the window, Antonio
saw Theophilo pacing up and down outside.  The
monk put on his hat and walked into the street.
</p>

<p>
"Senhor, this is terrible," moaned Theophilo.
"There is nothing."
</p>

<p>
"It is terrible indeed," answered Antonio, smiling.
"At half-past two you make me a promise, and at
half-past six you break it.  Come, remember.  Cheer up."
</p>

<p>
They walked beside him with downcast eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Come," he said again.  "This will never do.  Tell
me.  Does Donna Margarida know what you have
been passing through?"
</p>

<p>
"Thank God, she does not, and she never shall!"
cried Theophilo.
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  Let us go to your home and hear some
music and be gay.  I'm a country booby, and when I
visit the town I want to see some life.  It is dull in
the inn."
</p>

<p>
Theophilo became voluble in apologies for his negligence.
He despatched one of the stable-boys hot-foot
to warn the Senhora of their approach and followed
with Antonio and Luis.  In ten minutes they reached
a garish new house, faced all over with colored tiles.
</p>

<p>
Margarida received her old flame with slight chilliness.
Although she had turned thirty-five her good
looks were not greatly diminished.  With her sat
Perpetua, Jorge, Lucia, and Juliana, her four
black-eyed children, who were struck dumb by the advent of
the handsome stranger.  At first the proceedings were
dull and frigid enough to remind Antonio of his first
visit to Margarida's home.  But Luis and Theophilo,
in reaction from their days of stress and terror, soon
became almost hysterically gay.  The guitars came out;
and when everyone was tired of singing and strumming
<i>fados</i> Antonio devoted himself to the little Jorge
and his three tongue-tied sisters.  He gradually wooed
them out of their shyness by telling them a tale of the
buried city of Troja, at the mouth of the Sado.  By
the time he was half through a revised version of the
Three Hunchbacks of Setubal the audience had begun
to be more tongue-free than himself; and when he
made Perpetua hold the candle so that his clenched left
fist and his right-hand fingers and knuckles threw upon
the wall a shadow of a long-eared rabbit nibbling a
cabbage as big as itself, the house rang with shouts
of laughter.
</p>

<p>
The children were sent to bed at nine, wailing
bitterly at their banishment.  Theophilo took the guitar
and played softly, so as not to keep them awake.  He
had a sympathetic touch and his music soothed Antonio.
Sitting in a great chair, the monk looked round
the room and wondered.  His conto of reis had gone.
In forty hours it would be too late to pay the attorney,
and the usurers could be trusted so to foreclose the
mortgage as to swindle him out of nearly all he had.
Yet, somehow, he was happier than he had been for
many a day.  For a short while he asked himself if it
were not callous to gaze so calmly at the wreck of his
life's work.  Ought he not to be aching and smarting
and bleeding as he had ached and smarted and bled for
Isabel?  Did he truly care as deeply for the abbey and
for the Order as he had cared for her?
</p>

<p>
All these probings left him unpricked.  His contentment
obstinately refused to be ruffled.  Breaking his
rule, he drank two glasses of sweet wine and ate a
whole broa of Margarida's making.  When he rose to
go Margarida's manner was perceptibly less aloof, and
she begged him to come again.  At the street door
Theophilo said:
</p>

<p>
"Your Excellency has heaped kindness upon kindness.
How shall I ever repay him?"
</p>

<p>
"By permitting me to visit his house again
to-morrow night," answered Antonio; "your Worship
will have become my creditor.  Adeus."
</p>

<p>
He worked his hand free from Theophilo's iron grip
and returned to the hospedaria, where he fell asleep as
soon as his head touched the pillow.  Next morning,
after Mass, he did not lose a moment in opening
negotiations for the raising of an immediate conto of reis
on his encumbered assets.  But Luis and Theophilo, in
pledging all they possessed, had almost exhausted the
ready-money resources of Navares.  Late in the after
noon Antonio thought he was succeeding; but the
existence of the Oporto usurers' second mortgage on
the farm blocked the way.  At four o'clock he gave up
the struggle and went to Santa Cruz to say his Office.
At half-past five he sat down in the hospedaria to dine.
</p>

<p>
Just after the soup tureen had been placed on the
table a tremendous noise arose from the street.  Every
dog in Navares was outside, barking his hardest, and
the iron shoes of a spirited horse were hammering on
the cobbles.  The Gallego waiter rushed downstairs to
welcome the guest.  Doors banged, hostlers shouted,
buckets clanked, a horse neighed.  The inn cat, which
Antonio had been nursing, leaped from his knee and
rushed downstairs to the lobby whence the prolonged
wail of a badly scratched dog immediately ascended.
</p>

<p>
The monk, alone at the table, filled his gaudy plate
with vegetable soup and began to eat.  The stranger
came upstairs to his room amidst a babble of welcoming
voices.  Through the thin wall Antonio could hear
him drop his heavy boots on the bare floor.  A cheerful
splashing followed.  The Gallego waiter, hurrying in
with a dish of bacalhau, white cabbage, and hard-boiled
eggs, excitedly explained to Antonio that the newcomer
was an Englishman; and, five minutes later, a
plumpish, rather florid man, with a clean-shaven face
and soft yellow hair, strode into the room calling out
an order for green wine.
</p>

<p>
Antonio rose and found himself face to face with
young Crowberry.  But, somehow, he could not feel in
the least degree surprised.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, Teddy," he said quietly.  "Welcome
to Navares."
</p>

<p>
Young Crowberry jumped.  He stared blankly
across the soup at the gray-haired man with the gentle
voice.  Then he flung himself forward against the
table so impetuously that a brown water-pot was
overturned and an empty glass jumped down to the floor
with a crash.
</p>

<p>
"Da Rocha!  By Jove!  Da Rocha!" he cried,
wringing the monk's hand.  "Man, I've come all the
way from England to find you.  Why the deuce did
you drop writing?  And what do you mean by growing
gray hairs?  How's José and all the little Josés,
and the champagne and all the little champagnes, and
the orange brandy?  Have you pawned the spoons?
Da Rocha!  By Jove!"
</p>

<p>
"Come round and sit beside me," said Antonio.
</p>

<p>
As the deluge from the overturned water-pot had
soaked the cloth all round him the monk bade the
waiter remove his cover and young Crowberry's to the
little table by the window.
</p>

<p>
"And ask him to bring green wine," said young
Crowberry.  "Quarts, Gallons, Buckets, Hogsheads,
Bottomless pits.  I'm as thirsty as the devil."
</p>

<p>
When orderly conversation became possible, the
monk was able to puzzle out a mystery which had
pained him.  By comparing notes and sifting dates
they found that one letter from Antonio must have
gone down in the wreck of the mail-boat <i>Hortensia</i>,
and that another letter had reached England while
an unsatisfactory sub-tenant was occupying young
Crowberry's chambers.  After this misunderstanding
had been righted the monk proceeded to draw out his
friend's recent history.  He found that young Crowberry,
in his own phrase, had made three fortunes, of
which he had lost two and three-quarters in financing
foreign railway companies by whom he had been employed.
</p>

<p>
"But what does it matter?" demanded young Crowberry.
"I've a quarter of a fortune left, and I'm
hoping it'll be enough for my scheme.  The man I'm
trying to get in with isn't greedy."
</p>

<p>
"Explain," asked the monk.
</p>

<p>
"I'm hoping to buy a share of a snug little business
and settle down," young Crowberry answered.  "A
wine business.  I was born among bottles, and a
cellar's better than a tunnel.  That's why I've come to
Portugal.  I've invested four thousand pounds in
British Funds for miscellaneous purposes, and to-morrow
I'm going to offer my remaining five thousand to
a man named da Rocha for a partnership."
</p>

<p>
Antonio heard him without visible emotion.  For a
long minute he gazed quietly into the street.  At last
he said:
</p>

<p>
"Edward, you asked me half an hour ago if I had
pawned the spoons.  They were pawned two years
ago, to pay a Jew twenty per cent interest on a loan
I'd repaid twice over.  But it's a long story.  Drink
your coffee.  Then we will go to your room."
</p>

<p>
In young Crowberry's room Antonio disclosed his
secret.  He began with his brief experiences as a youth
in Lisbon.  Rapidly and vividly he described his brief
skepticism, his vocation to the religious life, his
noviciate, his full profession, his ordination, his expulsion
from the abbey, and his vow at the farm.  Omitting
only the affairs of Margarida and Isabel, he brought
the history right down to that very day and to the
moment of his failing to raise money in replacement of
Theophilo's conto of reis.  He slurred lightly over
every passage in the narrative which might sound like
self-praise, and sought rather to exhibit himself as a
blunderer who ought to have attained his end years and
years ago.  He wound up by saying simply:
</p>

<p>
"It is our Lord who has sent you here to-day.  If
you have it with you, I will borrow a conto of reis
and we will ride over to Villa Branca together in the
morning.  On the way we will talk about the partnership.
My maximum price for a half-share will be a
thousand pounds."
</p>

<p>
"My minimum offer is five thousand," said the
engineer firmly.  "Remember that I'm hoping to foist
myself upon you till death do us part.  I have wound
up all my affairs in England.  Meanwhile here is a
conto of reis."
</p>

<p>
Some one knocked loudly at the door.  It was the
Gallego announcing that two senhores wished to see the
Senhor da Rocha at once.  The senhores, treading
on the Gallego's heels, turned out to be Theophilo and
Luis.  They pressed into the room, but fell back at the
sight of a stranger.
</p>

<p>
"You may speak freely, Theophilo," said Antonio.
"This is the Senhor Crowberry.  He knows my
affairs.  Tell me what you want.  My own trouble is
over.  Senhor Crowberry has brought me a conto of
reis."
</p>

<p>
"And here it is," put in Crowberry, opening his
pocket-book.  "I don't know how much a conto may
be; but if it's less than two thousand pounds, help
yourself."
</p>

<p>
"No," cried Theophilo.  "We want nothing.  Senhor
da Rocha, I have wonderful news.  Sequeira has
come back.  He had mixed the town money up with
his own, but he is not a thief.  He has just come back
from Lisbon, and he has repaid me every vintem of
what Luis and I paid to the municipal chamber
yesterday.  See.  Here are the notes.  Seven contos and
two hundred milreis."
</p>

<p>
"And a special post has arrived from Leiria," added
the radiant Luis, "with a conto from Theophilo's
father.  Theophilo, show it to their Excellencies."
</p>

<p>
"How many contos are here?" asked Crowberry,
spreading out his notes.
</p>

<p>
"At the present exchange, you have at least twelve,"
said Antonio.  "A conto is a million reis of our money
and more than two hundred pounds of yours, at par."
</p>

<p>
"So we've twenty million reis altogether," Crowberry
chuckled.  "Let's change 'em into coppers and
swim in 'em to see what it's like.  Hasn't any
gentleman got a conto or two more?  I once knew a duke
who overlooked a whole threepenny-bit for a week.
It was in the lining of his old coat."
</p>

<p>
Luis and Theophilo stared at the Englishman with
open mouths.  They could not understand a word he
said, but this made him the more marvelous.  From
Crowberry they shifted their wonder to Antonio.  He
seemed to have called down from the skies a familiar
sprite who handed out millions as coolly as one boy
giving another a few screws of newspaper for the tail
of his kite.
</p>

<p>
"Put back your money, all of you," commanded
Antonio.  "Theophilo, give me your father's conto
and we are square.  And have I your leave to present
my friend to Donna Margarida?"
</p>

<p>
The whole party made haste to the tiled house,
where Jorge and his sisters hailed Antonio with shouts
of joy.  They were shy of young Crowberry at first;
but, having asked ten minutes' leave of absence, the
Englishman slipped out to a confeitaria and returned
laden with so exciting a load of candied oranges, Elvas
plums, Coimbra marzipan, and Spanish chocolate that
Antonio's star was eclipsed for half an hour.  The
guitars and the sweet wine came out once more.  Later
on young Crowberry began to tease poor Margarida
with such exaggerated compliments, in bad Portuguese,
that Antonio was forced to kick his heel and to explain
in hurried English that Navares was neither London
nor Paris.  But Theophilo did not take offense, and
the visit was entirely a success.
</p>

<p>
On the way home Antonio asked:
</p>

<p>
"Do you hear anything of Miss Kaye-Templeman
and Mrs. Baxter?"
</p>

<p>
"The widow Baxter is now the widow Lamb," answered
Crowberry.  "Lamb was a master-tanner.  He
survived the wedding six months.  That's all I know.
As for Isabel, I've heard nothing for years and years
and years.  After her father died she went to live with
Lady Julia Blighe.  By the way, you never told me
what you really and truly thought of her."
</p>

<p>
Antonio turned the subject.
</p>

<p>
"When you say," he demanded, "that you are planning
to live and die with me, what do you mean?  If
you are looking for a rural life, with the sports of a
country gentleman, England is the only place to find it.
If it's wine that interests you, I'm sorry; because you
drink too much already.  What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I am not looking for the sports of a country
gentleman," said Crowberry.  "As for wine, you are
mistaken.  I drink a glass or two a day of the lightest at
meals, and I never touch port or spirits.  Da Rocha, I
will tell you what I mean.  Perhaps you were pained
in my bedroom when I did not show great astonishment
at hearing that you are Father Antonio, a monk
of Saint Benedict."
</p>

<p>
"I was not pained.  But I wondered."
</p>

<p>
"Father Antonio, I guessed your secret years ago.
I guessed it on the voyage home from Lisbon.  I
guessed that you were working to regain the abbey.
From what Sir Percy told my father, I believed you
secured it after we went away.  I imagined that you
had resumed the cloistered life and that this was why
you didn't write to your old friends in the world."
</p>

<p>
"But you came out, this time, to become my partner
as a wine-grower," objected Antonio.
</p>

<p>
"Yes and No.  I came out with money to buy vineyards
and to work for my living as you have done.  I
meant to buy them as close to the abbey as I could.
I meant to seek you out and to ask you ... to
tell you..."
</p>

<p>
"Go on," said Antonio, taking his arm as they
walked, "To ask me what?  To tell me what?"
</p>

<p>
"To tell you that the burning desire of my soul,"
broke out the other ardently, "is to become a monk,
like you.  To ask you for your prayers and for your
help.  And when I saw you standing over your soup,
still in a layman's dress, I didn't alter my mind."
</p>

<p>
Antonio remembered the vision of young
Crowberry's future which had unrolled itself before him
while the youth and he sat side by side on the cloister
roof the day before Sir Percy failed to tear down the
azulejos.  In reverent thankfulness he listened to this
older Crowberry without interrupting him again.
But the Englishman misinterpreted his silence, and
added hastily:
</p>

<p>
"Let me be plain.  I don't claim to have the highest
and holiest vocation.  Some would say there is
cowardice in what I want to do.  I am running away from
the world.  The truth is that so long as I am in the
world I cannot love and praise God.  Whenever I
have a pit and a gallery to play to, I am a rattle, a
gas-bag, a mountebank.  In spite of myself I jest about
the holiest things, thus injuring others as well as
myself.  I want to work hard with my hands, to rise
early, to sleep and eat roughly, and to learn to pray.
Let people call me a coward if they please.  I'm
nearly forty.  I've made my money, and I'm standing
aside to let needier men make theirs.  Besides, I
hate railways.  They will do more harm than good."
</p>

<p>
Antonio was still mute.
</p>

<p>
"When a middle-aged man in my country has made
a competency," young Crowberry continued, "he
either remains in business to make money which he
does not need, or he retires and lives a life of selfish
and expensive pleasure.  A few, a very few, devote
themselves to philanthropy or politics, and I honor
them for it; but it has been breathed into my soul that
I am to help mankind by prayer.  Da Rocha, you are
silent.  You are shocked.  You think that, instead
of rising up early to pray, I ought to rise up early to go
hounding and shooting the poor beasts and birds who
have as much right to their lives as I have to mine."
</p>

<p>
"I have been silent," rejoined Antonio, "only
because I could not speak for thankfulness.  Nearly
twenty years ago I knew that you would become a
priest, and I hoped that you might become a monk."
</p>

<p>
"You consent?  I may be your pupil?" cried the
Englishman.
</p>

<p>
"I consent.  You may be my helper, my fellow-laborer.
You have much to learn and much to unlearn.
Listen.  This very night your training shall
begin.  Resolve that you will never again say you are
as thirsty as the devil.  The rest we will talk of
to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
Antonio smiled kindly as he spoke.  Young Crowberry
noticed that the monk's expression was full of a
solemn sweetness which had not been visible in the old
days.  At the same moment he became conscious of
Antonio's broken health.  The monk walked rather
slowly and leaned heavily on the layman's arm.  They
did not speak another word till they reached the inn
door.
</p>

<p>
Next morning, when Antonio awoke, he found
young Crowberry standing over him with a bowl of
Brazilian coffee and goat's milk, a newly-baked roll of
white bread, and, rarest delicacy of all, a pat of butter.
Protest was useless.  A quarter of an hour later the
sprucest barber in Navares appeared and shaved
Antonio with the skill of a German.  At seven o'clock
horses began stamping outside; and, at five minutes
past, Antonio and the Englishman were seated in a
well-hung carriage behind a pair of bays.
</p>

<p>
"Does the Jehu understand English?" asked
young Crowberry, cutting short Antonio's
remonstrances against all this luxury.  "No.  He
doesn't."  "Good.  Then, most reverend and illustrious Father,
listen to me.  One month from this date I, the most
irreverend Senhor Teddy Crowberry, will begin to be
your most docile servant.  I shall obey you in all
things.  You shall be my Lord Abbot till one of us
dies.  But, for this month, your Reverence will obey
me.  Argument is useless.  If I spend five guineas a
day for thirty days, remember that I hope to live on
fivepence a week for the following thirty years."
</p>

<p>
"A month!  It is impossible," cried Antonio.  "Besides,
José expects me back to-night."
</p>

<p>
"I think he doesn't.  An old ruffian on a white
horse has taken him a letter from me.  I was nearly
asking him to send on your shirts to the inn at Villa
Branca; but, if your Excellency will forgive my
disgusting rudeness, I couldn't feel sure that you had a
shirt to send.  From Villa Branca we shall go to
Oporto and punch the heads of those Jews.  We shall
wind up all your affairs there.  Thence we shall go to
Braga and see the Archbishop.  After that, back to
Coimbra, and to Lisbon to see the Patriarch and the
Pope's Nuncio, and perhaps to Evora.  See what a lot
I know!  I've been thinking it all over and over and
over in the night.  You are the only Benedictine left
in Portugal, and we shall have to get these big pots to
help us.  Pah!  How the sun does blaze.  I'm as
thirsty as an archbishop."
</p>

<p>
Young Crowberry had his way.  After the Villa
Branca attorney had been paid, Antonio was driven
to the principal inn and served with such a luncheon
as he had not eaten for twenty years.  The next day,
Sunday, after the military Mass, the monk ate a still
more elaborate meal and whiled away the hour of
digestion by reclining on the shaded balcony looking at
the promenaders in the Passeio and listening to the
band.  In the cool of the evening they set out in a
luxurious chariot towards Oporto.  Three days were
spent on the journey.
</p>

<p>
It was a triumphal progress.  One of young Crowberry's
first acts on arriving at an inn was to send
forward a mounted messenger, with full instructions,
to the next halting-place.  As these couriers bruited it
in every wayside wineshop that a bountiful Englishman
was on the road, Antonio's chariot was attended
by troops of brown-footed, brown-eyed, black-haired
children who threw flowers at the travelers and trotted
alongside the wheels pleading for "five little reis"&mdash;the
Portuguese farthing.  Instead of <i>cinco reis</i> young
Crowberry flung out tostões, or fivepenny pieces, such
as most of the youngsters had never handled on their
own account before, and the chariot rolled on amidst
pæans of joy.
</p>

<p>
In Oporto, where Antonio had supported life on a
few pence a day, the travelers put up at a
French-managed hotel and drank dry champagne from Reims.
Emboldened by this lively draught, young Crowberry
dealt with Neumann and Mual to such purpose that
they thankfully accepted three hundred pounds in full
discharge of Antonio's outstanding obligations.  With
the abbey deeds in Antonio's valise the travelers took
the direct road for Lisbon, where the archbishops and
bishops, as peers of the kingdom, had assembled for
the opening of the Cortes.  Here and there along the
route young Crowberry pointed out the cuttings and
embankments for the projected railway.  In Coimbra
they rested two days and read up every book they
could find in the University library which bore upon
the case before them.
</p>

<p>
Young Crowberry was for a theatrical burst upon
the whole bench of bishops in Lisbon; but the prudent
Antonio sought out his own diocesan and confided to
him the whole story.  The prelate heard him
attentively and with growing emotion.  He told Antonio
that the Dominicans and Franciscans had already
recovered certain houses in Portugal, and that the
Government, having got its money, was winking at the
return of the Orders.  He bestowed upon the monk
a fervent blessing and bade him return the next day.
</p>

<p>
Within forty-eight hours Antonio was received by
three-fourths of the Portuguese hierarchy, and by the
Papal Nuncio as well.  His tale brought tears to the
eyes of all, not excepting a political bishop who was
supposed to believe that Portugal would be better off
without the religious Orders than with them.  The
Nuncio dispatched a special memorandum to Rome,
and three of the bishops wrote long letters to Benedictine
abbots abroad, including an abbot-president, asking
for their counsel.
</p>

<p>
Young Crowberry's deportment among these dignitaries
left a little to be desired.  At his entrance he
would kneel and kiss the ring of a suffragan with
disconcerting ardor, and the next minute he would begin
to tell the Primate of the Spains a funny story in
execrable French.  On the whole, however, young Crowberry
was better liked for his worldliness than for his
piety.  His dinner at the Bragança Hotel made a deep
impression upon those ecclesiastics who were not too
dignified to assist at it; and when their magnificent
month drew to a close the Englishman and Antonio
left Lisbon with the knowledge that they had
committed no grave blunders and that they had made a
host of powerful friends.
</p>

<p>
José received the Senhor Crôbri warmly.  Within
two days of the Englishman's arrival at the abbey the
mortgages on the farm and the sea-sand vineyards
were cleared off and the silver spoons came back from
pawn.  On Saint Isabel's Day both José and young
Crowberry were assigned to cells in the monastery;
and from that morning community life was solidly
established and the work of God was regularly
performed in choir.  At Christmas, with Antonio's
permission, another novice arrived in the person of an
English clergyman who had been young Crowberry's
closest friend.
</p>

<p>
Months passed.  Twice Antonio received ecclesiastical
notables at the abbey and twice he was bidden to
Lisbon.  At length it was found possible to form a
small cosmopolitan community of monks from Brazil,
Spain, Bavaria, and Belgium.  As the sole link
between Portugal's old and new Benedictine life, and as
the savior of the abbey for his Order, every one looked
towards Antonio as the new Abbot.  But he set his
face like a flint against the plan.
</p>

<p>
"My Lord," he said to the Nuncio, who had been
expressly charged to impart to him the blessing of
Pio Nono, and to inquire what boon Antonio most
desired, "ask the Holy Father to intercede with those
who would make me Abbot against my will.  For
more than twenty years I have dwelt in the world,
buying and selling, and I am not fit to guide the
simplest monk in the religious life.  Suffer me to obey
my Master's word.  I hear Him saying, <i>Vade,
recumbe in novissimo loco</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Father Antonio stops his ears too soon," observed
the German Abbot-President who was assisting at the
interview.  "In the same verse of the Gospel he will
find also <i>Amice, ascende snperius</i>.  But let him be
consoled.  The anniversary of his ordination, and of
his expulsion from the house he has saved, is drawing
near.  On that day let him say his first Mass; and
after he has said it, let all things be set in order."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
VII
</h3>

<p>
On the day of his first Mass Antonio rose at dawn
and climbed the spiral stairway to his bench on the
roof of the cloister.  A cardinal, three bishops, and
two abbots were sleeping within the abbey walls, and
a duke and his duchess were up at the guest-house.
The monk yearned for solitude after a distracting
week, and the cell was too narrow for his expanding
and aspiring soul.
</p>

<p>
Muffled in a warm new cloak which young Crowberry
had forced upon him in Lisbon, Antonio bent
his whole mind and soul to the ineffably sacred and
glorious Work which lay before him.  At last, after
all these years of dogged battle, he had won the fight.
At last the dead Abbot's prophecy was about to be
fulfilled, and he, Antonio, was about to break the most
holy Body and to hold up in the great chalice the most
precious Blood.
</p>

<p>
To his dismay he found it difficult to meditate
steadfastly upon God's unspeakable Gift.  Try as he would,
he could not concentrate an undivided mind upon the
crowning mystery of faith.  That his thoughts should
wander a little on the morning of such an anniversary
was perhaps natural; but somehow every thought led
back to Isabel.  He rebuked himself sharply, and
forced his mind once more to pious thinkings.  He
called to memory the holy Francis of Assisi who died
a deacon, and the holy Benedict who died a layman.
If these two saints, who stood so high among all the
saints of the universal Church, had never presumed to
offer the Holy Sacrifice, how could he, Antonio, who
had lived less than ten years in religion and more than
forty in the world, dare to say this Mass?
</p>

<p>
Despite his efforts to dislodge it, the thought of
Isabel neither moved nor weakened.  Words which
she had spoken on the last afternoon at the cascade
rang like bugles through his brain.  In terrible wrath
and bitterness she had cried: "I will come back!  You
will succeed.  You will regain the abbey.  You will
fill it with monks.  But remember.  I will come back.
On the day of your triumph I will be there.  It isn't
only you Southern people who love revenge.  I will
be there.  I will come back!"
</p>

<p>
He rose from the bench and gazed at the calm Atlantic,
glittering under the first sunbeams.  But he
could not banish the echo of her words.  Isabel was
coming back!  Not for revenge.  Ever since the end
of his second novena to Saint Isabel he had rested
quietly in a firm confidence that his prayers for Isabel
Kaye-Templeman had been granted, and that his great
hope had been fulfilled.  She was coming back, not in
hatred, but in peace.
</p>

<p>
No.  All this was folly, and worse.  How could
she come back?  How could she, after twenty years,
find out what was happening in a corner of distant
Portugal?  The very idea was madness.  Nevertheless
Antonio could not drive it away.  He descended
to his cell, but her invisible presence seemed to fill it;
and it was only in the chapel that he firmly regrasped
the threads of his inward preparations for the coming
Sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
Eager whisperings in the nave drove him back to
his cell.  Lay folk from far and near were beginning
to arrive.  All of them had risen before daybreak, and
some of them had been tramping all night.  Throughout
the country-side an exaggerated account of
Antonio's acts and sufferings had sustained so much
embellishment that he was already being venerated as
a saint of heroic virtue.  Had he not, simply by
praying in the Navares church, caused an English lord to
spring up, so to speak, out of the earth with fifty
contos of reis, all in gold?  Had he not cast a devil
out of the shaggy, wild-eyed José?  Had he not
withstood the rich and beautiful Margarida?  Had he
not wrought the indisputable miracle of changing
common wine into champagne simply by standing a bottle
on its head?  Had he not driven away from the
azulejos the stiff Englishman with the icy, golden-haired
daughter, all by a supernatural spell of holy anger?
And, to crown all, was he not making a cardinal and
three bishops to grow where never more than one
bishop had grown before?
</p>

<p>
A little later the mere sightseers were reinforced by
files of devouter worshipers whose Christian souls
had glowed and burned at the tale of Antonio's
faithfulness; and, by degrees, the reverential expectancy of
these more earnest spirits hushed all unseemly
shufflings and whisperings.  According to Portuguese
custom there were no seats, and everybody knelt on
the floor.  As the nave became more crowded the
strange silence became deeper.  It was broken at last
by the unrestrained sobbing of the widow Joanna
Quintella, who was suddenly filled with bitter remorse
for having fastened upon Antonio his nickname of
"the abbey miser."  Her example was too much for
the weaker wills, and one after another joined her in
weeping.
</p>

<p>
The cardinal and the bishops, whose visit was
unofficial, had stipulated that they should not be expected
to make a ceremonious entrance or to bear themselves
with any appearance of defiance towards the
obsolescent laws against the Orders.  They seated
themselves without ostentation in stalls which were
only distinguished from the stalls of the monks by
thin cushions and kneelers stuffed with straw.  There,
with bowed heads, they prayed not only for Antonio
and for the restored Benedictine life of Portugal, but
also for a renewal of the fervor with which each one
of them had said his first Mass long years before.
</p>

<p>
On the stroke of ten the sacred ministers emerged
from the sacristy.  As his assistant priest Antonio
was accompanied by one of the new community, a
young Benedictine from Brazil.  A Franciscan from
a restored house in Entre Minho e Douro was deacon,
and the sub-deacon was the village cura.  The servers
were José and Brother Cypriano, last of the old
lay-brethren, who had arrived the night before from
Evora.
</p>

<p>
As Antonio appeared a murmur of awe escaped
from the intent crowd in the nave.  The monk had
recovered his power of concentration, and his face was
not like the face of a mortal man.  But he moved
forward, all unconscious that the people were not pleading
with God for mercy upon him as a poor and
presumptuous sinner.
</p>

<p>
To make a way to the sanctuary the acolytes had
almost to push through the people; and at one point
the procession was brought to a momentary halt.
Instantly a handsome woman, whom Antonio remembered
as one of the belles of Senhor Jorge's serão, held
up a puzzled, big-eyed child and said, in eager tones
loud enough for the monk to hear:
</p>

<p>
"Look, little one, look!  It is a saint that is passing
by!"
</p>

<p>
At the same moment a rough young farmer bent
forward and clumsily kissed the hem of Antonio's
chasuble.  The monk recoiled and almost let the
sacred vessels fall.  The man's touch and the woman's
words had cut him like knives.  A saint!  He, Antonio
the hard, the proud, a saint!  All the selfishness
of his life rose up before him.  His long coldness to
José; his persistent aloofness from the life of the
village which he ought to have shared and uplifted;
his whipping and driving of Isabel with whips of
rebuke and argument when he ought to have led her with
silken cords of sympathy; his repeated refusals of
charity when a little more fasting and a little more
labor would have enabled him to feed the hungry; his
self-esteem; his want of meekness under opposition
and insult&mdash;these, all these, were the solid facts of his
life, standing up as gaunt and huge as monstrous
rocks with only one poor shrunken runnel of love
trickling down between.  A saint!  If the sacred
vestments had not been hanging from his shoulders he
would have cried, "No, good people, no!  Pray for
me.  I am the poorest sinner of you all."
</p>

<p>
The crucifer cleared a passage through the kneeling,
murmuring, weeping people, and the procession moved
on, picking a way among the broad-brimmed hats and
wallets of provisions which lay on the pavement.
After making five or six yards of progress it came to a
halt again.  His pious preoccupation could not wholly
blind Antonio's eyes to the picturesqueness of the
sight.  The many-colored kerchiefs of the women, the
rich olive skins and glossy black hair of the children,
and the bright waistbands of the men were made ten
times more sumptuous by the cool, monotonous
background of blue-and-white azulejos.  Here and there
a knot of shepherds, in sheepskins, knelt with their
long staves rising up like spears above the heads of an
army.  Two or three fans moved languidly, like
gaudy flowers swaying in a breeze.  Straight ahead,
beyond the black monks and the purple prelates, rose
the high altar, with the Virgin and her Child enthroned
above the soft flames of six tall candles, set in
candle-sticks of burnished gold.
</p>

<p>
As the procession resumed its march Antonio's
glance was suddenly seized by a sight which almost
made him stumble.  Close to the wall, beside the
cloister doorway, knelt Isabel.  Her form was enveloped
in an exquisitely fine dust-cloak of silver-gray,
and a black lace mantilla covered her head.  Yet, even
before he saw her face, he knew that it was she.  The
cherubs in the azulejos above the doorway seemed to
be looking down upon her curiously, as if they found
in her something different from common clay.  Her
gaze was fixed upon the ground.
</p>

<p>
Recovering his self-control by a supreme effort,
Antonio advanced to the sanctuary and made the due
obeisances.  Then he knelt down before the altar.
No one wondered that his silent prayer was long; for
was he not a saint and was not this his first Mass?
The silence was profound from one end of the chapel
to the other.
</p>

<p>
But Antonio's prayers were not what the onlookers
thought.  Isabel had come back; and, according to his
practice, it was necessary to face the fact squarely in
the light of common prudence.  For nearly twenty
years he had cherished one great hope concerning her
until it had become a belief.  For nearly twenty years
he had given thanks to Saint Isabel for her miraculous
intercession.  But it was possible that, for nearly
twenty years, he had been hugging a delusion.
</p>

<p>
"On the day of your triumph I will be there."  So
she had spoken; and she was keeping her word.  "It
isn't only you Southern people who love revenge."  So
she had stormed on; and perhaps it was for revenge
that she was come.  With a sickening of heart
Antonio suddenly remembered reading in the Villa
Branca paper a sordid story of a passionate woman in
Sicily who had murdered a virtuous young priest on
the steps of the altar.  He remembered also young
Crowberry's account of the throwing of a bomb at the
new Emperor Napoleon in Paris.  So far as he knew,
such deeds were un-English; and, although Isabel was
imperious, he could not credit her with a smoldering
Latin vindictiveness leaping up into a fiery blaze of
showy crime.  Yet, after all, he knew so little of
women, so little of the new hysteria which men told
him was rife in the world.
</p>

<p>
What ought he to do?  For himself and for his
own life he did not care.  His work was done; and if
God willed that he should add the poor offering of
his own blood to the infinite worth of the immaculate
Host, he was ready to pour it forth.  But what if
there should be scandal, or, worse still, sacrilege?  Or
what if some desperate deed should wreak pain or
death upon the innocent people?  Ought he to rise
from his knees, and to implore the prelates to grant
him immediate audience in a place apart?  With the
whole might of his soul he besought Saint Isabel to
intercede for him and to show him God's will.
</p>

<p>
A child in the nave let fall a rosary of copper beads.
At the noise of the metal on the stone Antonio rose
up.  An inward voice bade him say his Mass and leave
the rest with God.  Making the sign of the cross, he
invoked the Triune Name and said, in a clear voice,
"<i>Introibo ad altare Dei</i>."
</p>

<p>
At the Confiteor his earnestness was so terrible that
the subdeacon shrank back, understanding for the first
time the blackness and foulness and meanness of the
smallest sin against the eternal holiness and majesty
and love.  Even in the nave, where it was impossible
to hear Antonio's voice or to see his face, the
poignancy of the monk's Confiteor made itself felt.  Like
ripe corn bowing before a wind, the most hardened
and careless bent lower and yearned forward in an
anguish of contrition for forgotten sins; and when
Antonio pronounced the words <i>indulgentiam, absolutionem
et remissionem</i> the whole chapel respired one
great sigh, as if a merciful king had just ended the
suspense of a culprit condemned to death.  At the
Gloria all hearts soared up like birds to hymn the
good God in the heights.
</p>

<p>
After the first Gospel one of the bishops arose to
preach.  He recited for a text the words of Isaias,
<i>Dicam aquiloni, Da, et austro, Noli prohibere.  Affer
filios meos de longinquo, et filias meas ab extremis
terrae</i>: "I will say to the north, Give, and to the south,
Hold not back.  Bring my sons from afar and my
daughters from the ends of the earth."  His
magniloquent exordium was worthy of the bishop's
reputation as the most eloquent preacher in the Peninsula.
In stately periods he began to show how north and
south had indeed given their sons to rebuild the
Benedictine Order in Portugal.  But, at such a moment,
his eloquence jarred.  He himself was the first to
become convinced of its discordance; and, suddenly
changing the key, he humbly asked the prayers of all
on Antonio's behalf and went back to his place.
</p>

<p>
The Creed, which young Crowberry and his clerical
friend had been brought up to regard as a penitential
chain dragging at the human intellect, was sung
more triumphantly than a battle-song or a national
anthem, with all the eagerness of enthusiastic faith.
When Antonio turned and said <i>Orate, fratres</i>, even
the sightseers prayed.
</p>

<p>
At last Antonio began the Canon.  At the
commemoration of the living, Isabel was the chief burden
of his prayer.  Having prayed for her, he thrust her
from his mind and pressed on to the supreme moment
of the Consecration.  Spreading his hands over the
oblation, he raised his eyes to the ivory figure of the
Crucified.  As he gazed, scales fell from his eyes.
He saw, as he had never seen before, the everlasting
sacrifice which lay behind and around the cross of
Calvary.  He saw behind the Victim who hung dying
for three hours on the first Good Friday, the <i>Agnus
qui occisus est ab origine mundi</i>, "The Lamb slain
from the foundation of the world."  He saw the
<i>Sacerdos in tetemum</i>, "The Priest for ever," <i>semper
vivens ad interpellandum pro nobis</i>, "ever living to make
intercession for us."  He understood that the
unutterable miracle of which he, Antonio, was about to
become the instrument was not a stroke of strange
magic, but a gracious overflow of that everlasting
intercession.  From books he had known these things
with his mind; but now he knew them with his whole
soul.  His priestly instrumentality, like the rod of
Moses, was about to strike the Rock; but the bright
stream waiting to gush forth was the everlasting love
of the Redeemer, flowing onward in its fullness
whether Mass was said or not.  Yet the children of
Israel had died of thirst had not Moses raised his rod;
and it was through him, Antonio, a weak and
unworthy priest on earth, that men were about to
receive the supreme bounty of the <i>Pontifex qui consedit
in dextera sedis magnitudinis in cÅ“lis</i>, "the High
Priest who sitteth on the right hand of the Majesty
in heaven."
</p>

<p>
When he elevated the sacred Host, Cypriano was
ready to ring the sacring bells; but awe stayed his
hand.  From the cardinal in his purple down to the
poorest hind in his sheepskin, all adored the God of
God and Light of Light.  Every heart cried, <i>Verbum
caro factum est</i>: "The Word is made flesh and is
dwelling among us, and we are beholding His glory."
</p>

<p>
Antonio pronounced the words <i>Simili modo</i> and
took the cup.  At last God was fulfilling the old
Abbot's prophecy: "I see Antonio standing before the
high altar.  I see him holding up our great chalice.
I see him offering the Holy Sacrifice for us all."  He
raised the great chalice, with the blood-red rubies,
which José had saved from the Viscount.  Once
again Cypriano tried to ring the sacring bell; once
again the general awe restrained him.  In deepest
reverence all adored the precious Blood.  Then burst
forth the thankful cry <i>Benedictus</i>: "Blessed is
He that cometh in the name of the Lord."
</p>

<p>
Very solemnly and intently Antonio made the memento
of the dead, especially of the dead Abbot and
the fathers and brethren of the old community.  He
had said the Pater Noster thousands and thousands of
times before; but as he stood before the altar every one
of its petitions ascended from his lips without a trace
of formalism or staleness.  And when the time came
for him to receive the celestial Bread, his <i>Domine, non
sum dignus</i>: "Lord, I am not worthy that Thou
shouldst enter under my roof," was not merely a devout
reading of seemly words from the printed missal; it
was an uttering forth of his inmost soul.
</p>

<p>
The sacrifice was consummated.  He took the ablutions
and covered the chalice.  When the deacon had
sung <i>Ite, missa est</i>, men and women who had never
tried to sing the response before joined the choir of
monks in thundering out a mighty <i>Deo gratias</i>.  Then
the prelates knelt to receive Antonio's blessing.  The
lordly cardinal was the first to kneel.  He knelt as if
he were the meanest altar-boy rather than a prince of
Holy Roman Church, and all the others made haste
to follow his example.  The monk, in deepest humility,
blessed the people.
</p>

<p>
Antonio's thanksgiving was less prolonged than his
brethren expected.  But when they crowded round to
escort him to the place of honor in the refectory he
begged most earnestly that the meal might proceed
without him.  To the fervid protests of the cardinal
and the foreign abbots he responded that from the
morrow onwards he would re-enter the path of
unquestioning obedience; but, for the remainder of this one
day he humbly sought leave to go and come as might
seem him good.
</p>

<p>
As soon as he had wrung out a reluctant consent
Antonio slowly crossed the cloister garden.  Two or
three of the new monks sprang forward to attend him;
but he waved them aside and went on, with slow steps
and bent head.  A bell clanged, and they melted away.
He quickened his pace until he gained the door with
the secret lock; and, before the echoes of the bell had
ceased humming in the still air, he was standing on the
causeway outside the cloister.
</p>

<p>
Not since the night of the thunderstorm had he
walked along those moss-grown slabs.  At the end of
the causeway, where he had lifted Isabel upon his
shoulder, he hesitated a short moment.  Then he
stepped down and followed a woodland path until
the soft thunder of the cascade boomed upon his ear.
The earth under his tread was sweet and bright with
thousands of May flowers, and the May birds sang as
they had sung on the May morning of Sebastian's last
Mass.
</p>

<p>
Not for twenty years had Antonio set foot within a
furlong of the stepping-stones.  But José had obeyed
his orders to the letter.  A few gaps in the trees had
been filled up, but otherwise nothing was changed.  As
he climbed the path the dull pounding of the tumbling
water drowned the crooning of the stream at his feet,
and at last he caught the silvery flash of the cascade
through the trees, like a great fish struggling in a
basket of reeds.  And the flash of the cascade was not
all Antonio saw.  He saw as well a fine silver-gray
cloak thrown down on a flat boulder; and standing
beside it, a nun of the Order of the Visitation.

</h3>

<p>
"I knew that you would come," said Isabel quietly as
Antonio emerged from the bushes.
</p>

<p>
"I knew I should find you here," Antonio answered,
more quietly still.
</p>

<p>
It seemed no more than a few feverish months since
their parting.  The boulder, the stepping-stones, the
pool, the cascade, the rapids, the palms, the mimosas,
the tree-ferns, the cypresses&mdash;all seemed unchanged.
He raised his eyes and gazed steadily at Isabel.  Time
had not filched away her loveliness.  Indeed, the nun's
head-dress served even better than the golden ringlets
of old to frame her beautiful features and to heighten
both the blueness of her eyes and the whiteness of her
brow.  Like her father before her, she held herself as
erect in middle-age as in youth.  If some of the girlish
bloom had gone, the loss was more than made good by
new charms of womanly tenderness and Christian
peacefulness.
</p>

<p>
"You see I have kept my word," she said, speaking
easily and quite naturally.  "On the day we parted, did
I not say that I would come back?  I have come."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," echoed Antonio, like a man in a dream.
"You have come."
</p>

<p>
"When you saw me," she added, with a smile, "perhaps
you thought I had come to shoot you or to stab
you; or to set the chapel on fire, bishops and abbots
and all."
</p>

<p>
Not for a moment had he lowered his gaze from her
face.  Merely to behold her again and to hear her
voice, whatever her words might be, was happiness
enough.  The accord between them was so perfect
that there was no need for questions, answers, news,
explanations, reminiscences, plans, greetings,
farewells.  But she was waiting for him to speak; and at
last, in the same dreamy tone as before, he pointed to
her nun's dress and said:
</p>

<p>
"This wonderful thing came to pass, did it not, on
the eighth of July, twenty months after you went
away?  That day was the feast of Saint Isabel of
Portugal.  It was also the last day of a novena I had
been making to this very end.  On that day, as I sat in
the chapel, I heard women's voices, far-off and sweet,
chanting the Divine Office; and I knew that this
miracle had come to pass."
</p>

<p>
"You were not mistaken," she said, in low tones.
"I awoke to my vocation on the eighth of July, the
year but one after I left this place."
</p>

<p>
Minutes passed before either of them spoke again.
Not that time and distance had been able to estrange
them.  They were one in heart and mind as they had
never been before.  But Isabel's mood had swiftly
become attuned to Antonio's.  It was enough to be at his
side on their old battle-field and to know how perfect
was their peace.  For a long while they stood speechless
with the great light of the Atlantic sparkling
before their eyes and the great music of the cascade
resounding in their ears.  Antonio was the first to
break the silence.
</p>

<p>
"Happiness is not the principal thing," he said, still
gazing at the sea.  "But I should like to know that you
are happy."
</p>

<p>
"I am happy," she answered in a firm voice.  "Entirely
happy."
</p>

<p>
"For that," he said simply, "I thank God."
</p>

<p>
Another silence followed, longer than the other.  At
last she said:
</p>

<p>
"You are weary.  You must sit down.  Our time
together is very short, so let me say what I ought to
say."
</p>

<p>
They sat down on the boulder.
</p>

<p>
"That afternoon you sent me away," she began, "I
went home with hatred and vengeance in my heart.  I
hated you and I hated God.  I did not sleep; but, until
dawn, neither did I shed a single tear.  My hatred was
like a terrible joy.  It filled me so full that it left no
room for grief.  But when the sun shone upon my
white roses and all the birds began to sing, my hatred
snapped like a dry reed, and I threw myself on the bed
and wept until I thought I should die.
</p>

<p>
"Gradually hope returned.  I knew that you loved
me; and I told myself that you would come to the
cascade and that you would fall on your knees and
implore my pardon.  I even decided what I would
wear, and I chose out a turquoise-blue ribbon for my
hair because I thought you had admired it.
</p>

<p>
"Happily I had some pride left.  I didn't go to the
Cascade.  But I bound my hair with the turquoise-blue
ribbon all the same, and waited for you to come to the
house.
</p>

<p>
"You know you never came.  Instead, your man
José appeared.  I heard chaff flying backwards and
forwards between himself and the servants.  Fisher
repeated some of it to me; and I learned that you had
started at sunrise on a long day's journey.
</p>

<p>
"That was the last unendurable blow.  You had run
away lest I should summon you again to the cascade,
or burst into your farm, or do some other shameless
thing.  It stung me to the quick.  I became in a single
moment as hard and cold as iron in a frost, and as
bitter as poison.  I pictured you coming up the next
morning to say a ceremonious Good-bye&mdash;coming up
all cool and self-possessed and hateful.  It was too
much.  I decided to join my father at once.  I
enforced my will like a tyrant; and, before you came
back, we were gone."
</p>

<p>
She paused.  Antonio's human heart was breaking
to tell her how he had passed that night kneeling on the
floor beside her bed.  But he held his peace; and Isabel
went on:
</p>

<p>
"In one point you did me immediate good.  I put
down my foot boldly, and insisted that we should
leave Portugal at once.  As soon as we landed in
England I sent Mrs. Baxter away.  But I grew more
hard and bitter every day.  At last, partly from
distraction, partly out of prudence, I mastered enough of
business to go through my own and my father's affairs.
One evening I made a cruel discovery.  It was only a
matter of five hundred pounds; but it overwhelmed me.
I found that this abbey had never been in any sense
mine.  From my father I found out his plan concerning
the azulejos; and from old Mr. Crowberry I found
that you knew how things stood all along.  Then I
remembered some of my words to you, and my frozen
heart melted at the sudden knowledge of your chivalry.
Even when I threatened to burn the abbey down you
held your tongue."
</p>

<p>
It puzzled Antonio that she should make so much of
so little.
</p>

<p>
"Not chivalry," he protested quietly.  "How else
could I have behaved?  Leave it.  Come, tell me,
Isabel, what first drew you to the religious life."
</p>

<p>
"I am telling you as fast as I can," she retorted, with
all the old quickness and spirit.  "From that day I
ceased to glower at the memory of you in sullen hate.
I began to be almost impersonally interested in your
conduct, your ideals, your character.  The theme
engrossed me all day long.  I recalled everything you
had told me of the years before we met.  I lived again
through every moment of the fortnight we were
together.  And it became plainer and plainer that I
could only explain you in one way.  You were too
healthy, too clear-eyed, too much of a man to be a
fanatic; yet you were breathing your every breath under
the sway of a supernatural idea.  Against my will I
was forced to admit that the idea must be true."
</p>

<p>
She paused again, weighing her words.  Then she
added:
</p>

<p>
"Of course, I knew that men have seemed to do
wonderful things under the sway of ideas that are only
delusions.  Your idea was not a delusion.  No man
can get out of a delusion one atom more than he has put
into it; but I saw that the idea&mdash;I mean, the
supernatural reality&mdash;which dominated your cool brain was
a reality from which you drew a mysterious something&mdash;a
something quite beyond your own self, quite beyond
your own nature.  I had felt it, time after time,
in your presence.  It was not an illusion.  It was
there, indisputably there.
</p>

<p>
"What could this something be?  I strove to square
it with a dozen theories in turn, and I gave it twenty
names; but not one would fit.  At last, it occurred to
me that after all, your own account of it might be true.
Antonio ... you can hardly understand.  In
England faith is weak.  There we have nearly all been
taught the greater Christian verities; yet it smote me
like a thunderbolt from heaven when I suddenly explained
your life on the theory that the whole Christian
gospel is truer than the stars.  At the most I had
believed that its truths had been realities in Palestine
eighteen hundred years ago, and that the devout
memory of them helped us and ennobled us to-day, like
a stirring tale that is told.  But, in one overwhelming
revelation, I saw it as the eternal life of men.  I can't
find words.  I saw it as something more vital than the
air, something nearer to us than our own selves.  I
saw it as an unquenchable light, with the sun blinking
in it like a farthing candle at noonday.  And I saw
your life, Antonio, reflecting that light and burning in
the midst of it like a gem."
</p>

<p>
He bent his head as if in pain; but she finished her
speech.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I understood your life at last," she said
very softly.  "It was the <i>vita abscondita cum Christo
in Deo</i>, 'the life that is hid with Christ in God.'"
</p>

<p>
"God knows," he rejoined solemnly, "that I am not
aping humility when I say that my life has been wilful
and sinful and proud.  Speak of such a life no more,
I entreat.  Speak of yourself.  Tell me how you
became a nun."
</p>

<p>
"As soon as I had accounted for your life," said
Isabel, "I was faced by a still harder riddle.  How
was I to account for my own life; and especially, for
the way my life had become intertangled with yours?
At the first glance I seemed to have been thrown across
your path merely to try you.  I seemed to be merely
a single rung in your ladder to perfection.  But, to be
candid, I was not humble enough to rest satisfied with
that.  Surely I had some rôle of my own.  To be
simply another person's trial, another person's
springboard to heaven, was not enough for a whole life.
</p>

<p>
"Throughout one black week my new-found faith
suffered an almost total eclipse.  I rebelled in loathing
against God for sacrificing me in the cause of your
monkish perfection.  Why should he have chosen me
for so dreadful a work instead of some woman who
had had her share of happiness?  His cruelty seemed
devilish.
</p>

<p>
"My doubts grew until they broke of their own
weight.  One day, soon after my poor father died, I
had been bitterly recalling what seemed to be the
cruelest fact of all&mdash;the fact that, for four years before I
saw your face, I had lived in the supernatural persuasion
that you were my destiny and that your life
needed mine.  Suddenly it flashed upon me that a
man and a woman may be predestined to commingle
their lives on some basis other than conventional love
and marriage.  I knew that my love for you was not
such love as I saw among the lovers and the married
people around me; and that from ordinary marriage
I had always recoiled.
</p>

<p>
"It was on the strand of a beautiful English bay,
with white cliffs running out miles into the blue water,
that I worked out this new thought to the logical end.
It was the eighth of July.  At about eleven in the
morning I held the key in my hand.  Antonio, I did
not love you less; but my new faith rushed back a
million fold and I loved God so much more that at last I
saw my love for you in its true light.  I saw it as the
means to an end.  I saw that you had been sent to
me, as Saint Philip was sent to the treasurer of Queen
Candace, to make me a Christian.  You, a monk, were
raised up to make me a nun.
</p>

<p>
"I saw much more.  I saw that, for years and
years, I had been fighting for happy human
relationships.  I, for whom God's love had reserved this
richer bliss, had cried out, year after year, for a
father, a mother, a sister, a brother, a friend.  My
bitterest cry, Antonio, had been for you; but God
knows that I had cried out for you less as a husband
than as a comrade and a most dear friend.  On that
July morning I saw why our Lord had refused me
the lower good to grant me the higher, and how He
had sorely wounded me that His balm might more
sweetly heal me."
</p>

<p>
Isabel ceased.  Her long speech had been growing
less and less easy until she could not utter another
word.  The nun thought that the cause was in herself.
Why had she not confined herself to reciting
the precise words with which she had come prepared?
Or why had she not taken the still better course of
throwing all her preparation to the winds and of
pouring out her heart to Antonio in whatever words
might come?  Why had she muddled fragments of a
set speech with a nervous impromptu?
</p>

<p>
She did not know that the cause of her failure was
in the listener.  Although her story told Antonio that
his dearest prayer had been superabundantly
answered, the old wound in his heart was bleeding
afresh.  For half a moment, with an exquisite
spiritual jealousy which was beyond his will, he was
jealous of his Lord.  Throughout the long years of his
growing love of God his chaste love of Isabel had
never died; and he could not bear the thought that
perhaps this love was no longer requited.  He tried to
speak; but his tongue was tied.  Antonio's heart sank.
What was this mystery?  How was it that their accord
was broken at the very moment when it should
have been most perfect?
</p>

<p>
When the pause had become intolerable Isabel ended
it.  She began speaking quickly and nervously.  The
forced lightness of her tones contrasted almost
painfully with her grave earnestness of a few minutes
before.
</p>

<p>
"Your question is answered," she said.  "I have
told you how I became a nun.  I did not rush into a
convent, like a damsel of romance, out of chagrin at
a disappointment in love.  My disappointment, if we
may use the word, was only the means of opening my
eyes to a vocation as real as your own."
</p>

<p>
Only!  Antonio could see that their wonderful love
had accomplished all she said.  But was it only that,
and nothing more?  Again he strove to speak; again
he failed; and again it was Isabel who ended the
pause.
</p>

<p>
"For three or four months," she said, in an even
more matter-of-fact tone than before, "I lived with
Lady Julia Blighe.  I entered the convent at
Christmas.  Probably you, a monk of Saint Benedict, can
hardly take the convents of our Order seriously.
Our chant is made easy, all on three notes.  We have
flowers in our rooms.  Each nun has a silver spoon.
I have always been a coward when it came to physical
hardships."
</p>

<p>
"I know your Order and I revere it," protested
Antonio, finding speech at last.  "You are not a
coward.  The inward mortification is harder to practise
than the outward.  I know that the poor people used
to call your nuns 'the holy Maries.'  But tell me how
you are employed."
</p>

<p>
"I teach in the school," she answered.  "That is
why I am here to-day.  Let me explain.  We have
had in our care three sisters from the Beira Alta,
daughters of a Portuguese Marquis.  Their education
is finished.  I brought them out to Oporto and handed
them over to their parents last week.  Before I left
England I told our Mother Superior all about you,
save your name, and it is with her consent that I have
come here to-day.  But I believed that your monks
had been restored years and years ago.  I expected
to see you for half an hour in a monastery parlor.  A
sister of the Third Order of Saint Dominic is
traveling with me on her way to bring back some pupils
from Lisbon.  We reached your little town, Navares,
last night.  There we heard this news.  The people
could talk of nothing else."
</p>

<p>
The hardness went out of her tone, and her voice
faltered as she added softly: "They told me, Antonio,
that this would be your first Mass.  They told me how
you have fought and what you have suffered."
</p>

<p>
The blue eyes which looked at him so wistfully as
she spoke were the blue eyes which had brimmed with
tears twenty years before when she had "cried and
cried and cried like a baby" at the sight of his
worn-out cloak and had sobbed: "Poor Antonio!  You poor
Antonio!  My poor Antonio!"  His heart broke at
the sight.  After twenty years she had come back.
Amidst the old sights and sounds she was sitting
hardly an arm's length from him.  Isabel had come
back.  But in less than one little hour they must
stand up for the last parting and he would never see
her in this world any more.  And meanwhile a frosty
monster of false reserve was devouring their tiny
store of golden moments one by one.
</p>

<p>
Antonio sprang to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Isabel," he said desperately, "you think I didn't
care.  You think I never loved you.  Listen.  The
night you went away I was ready to drop down with
fatigue and hunger after riding and tramping from
sunrise to sunset over the mountains.  But how did I
spend that dreadful night?  I spent it in your chamber,
kneeling on the floor against your bed, drinking
deep of such anguish for you as I pray God you have
never tasted for me.  How did I spend the next day?
Only by miracle upon miracle was I held back from
thundering after you on the fleetest horse in the
country-side.  Hour after hour that day I tramped,
tramped, tramped north, forgetting God and thinking
only of you, till I came to a saint's grave."
</p>

<p>
She rose hastily and raised one slender white hand,
as if to ward off his burning words.  But he would
not be put to silence.
</p>

<p>
"Call me a sentimentalist, a madman, an apostate,
anything you will," he cried.  "But here is the sheer
truth.  Whenever I sat down to eat and drink at the
farm you were there, invisibly but undeniably there,
sitting at my right hand.  Whenever I went into my
cell I heard you searching in the cupboard for
something you could not find.  You haunted these woods
all night and all day.  To enter the guest-house was
like being dragged into a chamber of torture.  More.
Believe me or not, as you will.  To-day is the first
time for twenty years that I have set foot on these
stones, or set eyes on yonder cascade, or touched this
boulder with my hand.  Isabel, in memory of you I
have charged José to tend this place like a shrine; but
I behold it now for the first time since I stood here, at
sunrise, the day after you went away."
</p>

<p>
His words burst from him like a stampede of eager,
bright-eyed creatures suddenly released from long
captivity.  It was as though he would storm and batter
down the gates of her heart and reclaim his ancient
place.  She recoiled from him.
</p>

<p>
"No more, no more!" she cried.  "I did not come
for this.  Antonio, in God's name, no more!"
</p>

<p>
"It is in God's name," he retorted, "that I must and
will say more.  Isabel, when you went away I did not
know I loved you.  I thought my grief was no more
than an aching, bleeding wound of sympathy, of pity.
But, little by little, I came to know that I loved you.
Not with profane love.  I came to believe that our
Lord had vouchsafed to me a love such as unfallen
man would have had for unfallen woman, and I believed
that you, Isabel, loved me with as holy a love in
return.  It was not a love which weaned me from the
love of God.  It was a way of loving God more, and
of loving Him more perfectly.  I even learned to
thank God for our separation; because I knew my
human weakness and I knew how swiftly this love of
you, which was also a love of God, might be changed
into a deceitful love of self.  But to-day what do I
find?  That your love for me was only a delusion, a
phase, a stage, a means to another end&mdash;that, and that
only."
</p>

<p>
He strode up and down, as if he would shake from
his shoulders this last and heaviest of his griefs.  But
when he reached the spot where he had pronounced
his final answer twenty years before he heard a step
at his side and felt a light touch on his hand.
</p>

<p>
"No, Antonio," she said "No.  Not that and that
only."
</p>

<p>
He started violently.  She was facing him, with
downcast eyes and with the rose-pink of girlhood once
more glowing in her cheeks.  Her voice was low and
sweet.
</p>

<p>
"Antonio," she said very slowly, "how strange it all
is, and wonderful!  You sent me away in autumn,
when the sun made haste to set and the storm had torn
the leaves from the trees.  I have come back in the
spring, amidst thousands of birds and millions of flowers.
I have come back in the sunshine to find that you
loved me even more than I loved you."
</p>

<p>
Her voice died away so gently that Antonio could
not be sure whether the headlong waterfall and the
delirious birds had not robbed him of some sweet
saying.  At last she spoke again and said:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Antonio, you loved me more than I loved
you.  But do not think that I loved you little or
lightly.  Above all, do not fear that my love is dead.
Antonio, I will tell you what I had never meant to tell
anybody in this world."
</p>

<p>
He waited a long time before she began her
confession.  To help her he bent his gaze upon the
ground.  At last he heard her speaking, so softly that
he had to strain his ears to listen.
</p>

<p>
"I, too," she said, "cherished such a love.  But I
am no theologian.  Although my love of you had
awakened my love of God, I thought it was wrong to
go on cherishing it after its work was done.  For
years and years I thrust it away as a snare.  I so
crowded my waking hours with prayer and labor and
study that no time was left for other thoughts.  But,
time after time&mdash;not thrice, or ten times, but five
hundred&mdash;my nights have been rosy with the same
wonderful dream.  In my dream I seem to have entered
into the bliss of heaven, and to be moving in the
fullness of the love of God, as in a soft glory of
life-giving golden light.  At the beginning of my dream
it is always a churchly heaven, pillared and domed,
with holy chants drifting hither and thither like clouds
of incense and with clouds of incense mounting upward
like holy chants.  But, little by little, it changes.
The dim dome widens and brightens into a blue sky,
with the smoke of the incense sailing in it like pearly
clouds; and the stark pillars soften into tree trunks
crowned with cool foliage and hung with clinging
roses.  Instead of rolling organs I hear the surf of a
summer sea breaking on soft sand, and instead of the
chants I hear the birds, and thousands of brooks
ringing like little bells.  Cool grass, gay with wild
flowers, spreads itself in the place of golden streets and
marble pavements.  But, all the time, the same holy
light is over it all, like the light before a summer
sunset among green hills.  Then I become conscious that
the heaven I am walking in is not some strange
unhomely land high above the stars.  <i>Video cÅ“lum
novunt et terram novam</i>: 'I see a new heaven and a
new earth,' and I know, with sudden joy, that I am
walking in this beautiful world, made new, purged of
evil and pain, and wholly conformed to the mind of
God.
</p>

<p>
"My dream unfolds always in the same way.
Gradually I see that the woods in which I am walking
are woods I have walked in before.  The voices of the
sea and the brooks are good to hear, because they are
the voices of old friends.  At last I push past a
mimosa, on fire with golden flowers like a burning bush,
and I halt on the margin of this pool.  I wait, with
the cascade rumbling at me like thunder and flashing
at me like lightning.  I turn round; and, without
hearing your footfall, I find you at my side.  Then we
wander off together, sometimes down deep ravines,
sometimes up through pines to brown moorlands purple
with heather, sometimes along the banks of lakes
and rivers, or along the sea-shore, with the holy light
always over us and with God's love nearer to us than
our own souls.  That is my dream."
</p>

<p>
After pausing a little, she added:
</p>

<p>
"At first I thought my dream was a snare.  I say
again that I am not a theologian.  Still, I tried to
puzzle out if such dreams were against sound doctrine.
At first I feared they were.  But I came to see that
the words of our Lord, 'In the resurrection they
neither marry nor are married,' referred to marrying
of an earthly kind.  Many another scripture came to
my mind; and many another thought came to
comfort me.  Our Mother, the Blessed Virgin crowned in
heaven&mdash;is she not a woman still?  And do we not
think of this saint or of that as still a man or still a
woman, as the case may be?  Is the life hereafter to
be a blank Nirvana?  Will it be less richly personal
than the life we are living now?  But these are only
my own poor thoughts, worth less than nothing.  I
rest rather in two great scriptures.  <i>In domo Patris
mei mansiones multÅ“ sunt</i>: 'In my Father's house are
many mansions.'  And again, 'Eye hath not seen, nor
hath the ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of
man what things God hath prepared for those who
love Him.'  But let me be plain to the end.  My
dreams are beyond my control; and, when I am awake,
I do not willingly dwell on these thoughts."
</p>

<p>
The big bell of the monastery, vocal once more after
seven-and-twenty years of silence, struck twelve.  The
monk and the nun listened to the strokes without
speaking.  Before the last echoes died away Brother
Cypriano rang the Angelus.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Angelus Domini nuntiavit MariÅ“</i>," said Antonio,
with bowed head.  And Isabel responded:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Et concepit de Spiritu sancto</i>."
</p>

<p>
When the pious exercise was finished she said:
</p>

<p>
"It is time to go."
</p>

<p>
"No," cried Antonio, suddenly perceiving that she
had picked up her cloak and mantilla.  "You must
not go."
</p>

<p>
"I must go," she said, smiling gently.  "Antonio,
things are changed indeed.  In the old days your great
aim was to drive me away."
</p>

<p>
"You must not go," he said, with the utmost
energy.  "The Duchess of Ribeira Grande is at the
guest-house, with servants.  There is room for you
and for your friend the Dominican sister.  You need
rest, until to-morrow.  You must not go."
</p>

<p>
She shook her head, still smiling gently, and held
out her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Antonio," she said.
</p>

<p>
He took the hand; but instead of grasping it and
letting it fall he held it, and said once more:
</p>

<p>
"Until to-morrow you must not go."
</p>

<p>
She began to disengage her fingers.  Antonio
gripped them fiercely and pleaded not only with his
voice, but with his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Isabel," he said, "one room at the guest-house is
still yours.  It can be made ready for you and for
your friend to-night.  It is your old room, with the
white roses.  I have suffered no one to enter it for
twenty years."
</p>

<p>
This time she left her hand in his.  The monk's
voice, his brown velvet eyes, his clasp, and the rush of
old memories were too much for her.  She trembled
a little; and suddenly a rain of tears fell upon
Antonio's hand.
</p>

<p>
"Antonio," she sobbed, "I must go.  Now.  Don't
ask me again.  But, before I go, there is one thing
more to tell you."
</p>

<p>
For many moments her weeping would not let her
speak.  At last she whispered between her sobs:
</p>

<p>
"That little bowl.  The bowl you gave me, with the
blue-and-orange bird.  Do not despise me.  When
the time came, I felt I could give up the whole world,
except that.  For two months I turned a deaf ear to
God, all because I couldn't give up ... that."
</p>

<p>
The exceeding bitterness of the memory made her
sob afresh.  When she could speak again, she said:
</p>

<p>
"Antonio, I will tell you where the little bowl is
to-day.  It has been made into a lamp.  I had it encased
in brass, so that it cannot break, and plated over with
the purest silver.  It hangs in a little church, in a slum
near the London docks.  It burns before the image of
Saint Antonio."
</p>

<p>
Antonio could not speak.  He forgot that he was
still holding her hand, and she did not remember that
she had not taken it away.  After a long time she
murmured, almost inaudibly:
</p>

<p>
"Antonio ... one night I gave you a rose."
</p>

<p>
He released her white fingers.  Then he drew forth
his breviary and placed it in her hand.  She took it
wonderingly; but he averted his eyes.  Isabel gazed at
the worn volume.  She could see that there was some
kind of a book-marker, marking the Office of the
day.  She opened the book and saw a pressed white
rose, flecked and veined with faint blood-red.
</p>

<p>
She looked at it a long, long while.  Then she shut
the book and gave it back to Antonio.  Without
another word he wrapped the thin wrap about her form
and helped her to arrange the mantilla on her
shoulders.  When the moment of parting came she simply
gave him her hand, like a proud English lady; and he,
like a courtly Portuguese gentleman, bent over it and
lightly kissed her finger-tips.
</p>

<p>
She went away by the path she had taken on
their last afternoon, twenty years before.  Antonio,
strangely calm, watched her as she pressed up the
steep way.  He was conscious that she still walked
with willowy, girlish grace.  He remembered how
he had watched her that other afternoon, and how he
had wondered if she would turn round and look back.
</p>

<p>
The two cypresses hid her from his sight.  He
breathed a quiet prayer for herself and for him.  But
he did not close his eyes; for they were fixed on the
one point where she would reappear.  His being was
filled full with such peace and bliss as he had never
known.
</p>

<p>
She reappeared.  She turned round.  She waved
her hand.  She was gone.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
As soon as Antonio re-entered the porch of the
monastery the Fathers thronged forward pressing him to
break his long fast.  But he shook his head and
trudged on, looking neither to the right hand nor to
the left.  In the cool cloister he paused a moment
upon the slab which covered the body of Sebastian.
Then he turned into the narrow doorway and climbed,
with dragging steps, to his old seat on the flat roof.
One of the younger monks tried to follow; but José
and Cypriano barred his passage.  The two sturdy
fellows, eyeing one another jealously, stood guard on
either side of the gloomy opening, like two genii
keeping the door of a cave.
</p>

<p>
Antonio sat down on the bench of cork.  At the
same moment a carriage rolled out through the principal
gate of the abbey.  He knew that it was bearing
Isabel to rejoin her friend at Navares.  Down the
dusty hill it went; past the farm; and onwards until it
was no more than a tremulous black spot against the
whiteness of the road.  As it approached the
pine-woods some plate of burnished brass in the harness
caught the light and blazed at Antonio for a moment,
like a tiny sun.  Then the shadow engulfed it, and he
saw it no more.
</p>

<p>
Very calmly and with perfect concentration of mind
Antonio resumed his devout thanksgiving for his first
Mass.  God had enabled him to rebuild His broken
altar and to offer upon it the Holy Sacrifice.  In the
dazzling refulgence of that immense grace his sufferings
and hardships were no more than grains of dust
dancing in a sunbeam.  The chief events of his past
re-enacted themselves before him, like a stage show, and
he saw that his life had been an unbroken pageant of
divine mercy, full of glittering lights and rich shadows.
He recalled all that God had done in him, and <i>vidit
quod esset bonum</i>; "he saw that it was good."
</p>

<p>
When the monk's thanksgiving was finished Isabel
reclaimed his mind.  The strange peace which had
descended upon them both, as she gazed at their white
rose, abode with him still.  There was no rebellion in
his soul, no ache in his heart.  The whole history of
their love unrolled its bright length before him, like a
holy scroll illuminated in blue and blood-red and gold,
and he found nothing written therein that he would
have altered or erased.  <i>Vidit quod esset bonum</i>.  It
was good, all good, to the end.
</p>

<p>
He sat and pondered upon their wonderful love.
At first he was confident that Isabel and he, he and
Isabel, were the lovers of lovers, the supreme lovers
of all time.  But humility brought him a larger
thought.  Surely, before Isabel and he were born,
there had been men and women loving as purely and
as grandly.  And surely there would be men and
women loving as grandly and as purely after he and
Isabel were dead.
</p>

<p>
Compared with all this love, of all these lovers in all
the past and all the present, surely the shining of
the sun was as darkness?  He closed his eyes that he
might behold the greater light.  And, in that
surpassing radiance, he seemed to be reading the deepest
secrets of eternity and to be solving the riddle at the
inmost heart of the universe.  He saw innumerable
loves ever ascending, like golden mists, out of the love
of God.  He saw those innumerable loves returning
into the love of God again, like rivers into the sea.
And with every return of love he saw the love of God
growing richer and sweeter, like a fruit ripening in
the sun.  It seemed as if even God himself were
waxing greater and as if, in the act of creation, the
Creator took as well as gave.  Without creation God must
still have been perfect; but even God could rise from
the lower perfection to the higher.  Without creation
the eternal Word was like a trumpet blown on an
illimitable plain: but, with creation, the Word was
like that same trumpet resounding and reverberating
amidst re-echoing hills.  God had need of man.  God
was Love, a pure white ray of love, and humanity
was a prism turning this way and that and breaking
the whiteness into the fairest colors.  All love was
one.  Antonio's love for Isabel, Isabel's love for
Antonio, was a drop flung forth from the bottomless
ocean of the love of God to shine like a gem in the
sunlight.
</p>

<p>
No.  Not like a mere grain of spray which leaped
free and sparkled for a moment and then fell back to
lose its identity for ever.  Rather was it like the
immortal soul of a new-born babe, a something suddenly
existing, a something with no past, but with an
everlasting future, a something with an eternal
identity which even God himself could not destroy.  God
would no more revoke and destroy His emanations
of love than He would revoke and destroy His
emanations of being.  Innumerable loves would chime for
ever in noblest harmony with the love of God, like
brooks murmuring with the sea&mdash;<i>vox turbÅ“ magnÅ“,
vox aquaram multarum et vox tonitruorum magnorum</i>:
"a voice of a great multitude, a voice of great waters,
a voice of mighty thunderings."
</p>

<p>
The monk rested awhile in this thought.  He knew
it was the thought of Isabel's dream.  But suddenly a
white light blazed in his soul.  Isabel vanished as if
she had never been.  All the human love he had been
cherishing fell from him, like a dying torch from the
grasp of a man who strides forth out of a cave into the
blinding light of a summer noon.  Antonio was caught
up into an ecstasy of the pure love of God.
</p>

<p>
When he opened his eyes at last and gazed upon the
Atlantic he knew that he was weary.  The hands were
weary that had labored so roughly for his Lord.  The
feet were weary that had tramped so many a league in
dust and heat; and the brain was weary that had
puzzled and worried and planned till it could puzzle and
worry and plan no more.  But it mattered not at all.
Was not the day's work done?  There was plenty of
time to sleep.  Ranging over wood and meadow and
stream, Antonio's gaze came to rest in the little
clearing between the ending of the orange-groves and the
beginning of the vineyards; and he looked with
longing at the white cross which rose tall and slender
above the monks' graves.
</p>

<p>
Peace filled earth and heaven.  His tired eye-lids
drooped over Antonio's eyes.  The airs around him
were rich with scents of lemon-blossom and
suckle.  The Atlantic lay unvexed by wind; and the
ocean swell, as it searched the creeks and caves,
hummed no louder than a heavy-laden honey-bee
lumbering home.
